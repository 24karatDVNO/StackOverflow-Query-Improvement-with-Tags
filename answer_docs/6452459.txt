<p>The only thing you could do to wrap text around an image is to float the image. But this way the image could be only to the left or to the right of the text, not in a position defined by you.</p>

<p>Look here <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/e5LQS/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/e5LQS/</a></p>

<p>You can make many columns of text, put the image you want in one of the columns, so that the text will wrap around it. But you cannot have an image in the middle of two columns or rows with the text wrapped around it, because that would mean have a position absolute for the image, and the text won't consider it and simply ignore the image.</p>
