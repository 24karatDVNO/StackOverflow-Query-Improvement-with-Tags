<p>ASP.NET postback works by submitting a client side form with two additional values, <code>__EVENTTARGET</code> and <code>__EVENTARGUMENT</code>. ASP.NET uses these to determine which control to find, and which event to fire. You could do:</p>

<pre><code>if (IsPostBack)
{
    string controlId = Request["__EVENTTARGET"];
    // Do something with the control Id.
}
</code></pre>
