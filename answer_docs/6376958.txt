<p>The type inference scheme has gotten confused by the types available--specifically, by the type of cls.  If we write generic code:</p>

<pre><code>def clser[A](cls: Class[A]) = allCatch opt cls.getConstructor(classOf[Project])
</code></pre>

<p>then it works perfectly okay.  But you're probably doing something else--I can't tell what because you didn't provide the code--and this results in a mismatch between the expected and actual types.</p>
