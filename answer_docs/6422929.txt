<p>so when I mentioned 'redirect call happens from different server to my page' I was trying to mention it as back channel call. And being a back channel call, browser cookies were not getting identified I suppose and that is the main reason even if setcookie returns me true, actual cookie deletion from browser would never happen in such cases.</p>
