<p>I think the "incompatible types" should only be a warning.
If it is an error then try casting the buffer to char* when you give it to the function.
But this is a quick and dirty solution
Maybe you should think about a more generic solution that does not produce this error.</p>

<p>The parsing of the data should be the workers job.
If you let the master parse it would slow him down.</p>
