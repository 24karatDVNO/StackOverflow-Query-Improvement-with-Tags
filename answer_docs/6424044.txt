<p>Erm, use nested if statements? I'm not entirely sure what you want to do with the result of the second condition, but here's what it looks like if the first condition isn't met:</p>

<pre><code>if (condition1) {
  // First condition succeeds

  // Assuming you want to execute this either way
  if (condition2) {
  }

  // Only execute if first condition succeeds
  if (condition3) {
  } else {
  }
} else {
  // First condition fails

  // Assuming you want to execute this either way; ignore otherwise
  if (condition2) {
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note also that if you want to return a value from a function, you can use something like <code>if (!condition1) return false;</code>.</p>

<p>As for whether the above is what you're looking for: this question is mad ambiguous.</p>
