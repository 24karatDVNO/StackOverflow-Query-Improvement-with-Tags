<p>The proposed algorithm stores only a single bit of information in the temporary array <code>T[N]</code>, namely whether it's reachable at all. Obviously, you can store more information at each index <code>[N]</code>, such as the values <code>C[i]</code> used to get there. (It's a variation of the "Dealing with Unlimited Copies" chapter in the PDF)</p>
