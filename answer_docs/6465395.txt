<p>I have previously used <a href="http://www.trilead.com/SSH_Library/" rel="nofollow">Trilead SSH</a> which was great and simple to use. Unfortunately Trilead don't support it anymore, however according to <a href="http://linuxmafia.com/ssh/java.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a> (lots of SSH links there) the ex-Trilead version is now <a href="http://www.cleondris.ch/opensource/ssh2/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
