<p>I am pretty sure there is no way to turn a bunch of arbitrary SQL statements into an ADO.net DataSet without running the SQL commands through a database engine that understands the SQL in the dump file.  You can't even do it between databases, e.g. a MySQL dump file will not run on an MS SQL server</p>
