<p>If elt was allocated as</p>

<pre><code>elt = (ngx_hash_elt_t*)malloc(sizeof(ngx_hash_elt_t));
</code></pre>

<p>, then it will cause an overflow with strings longer than 1. However, most probably, it was allocated as:</p>

<pre><code>elt = (ngx_hash_elt_t*)malloc(sizeof(ngx_hash_elt_t) + maximum_possible_length);
</code></pre>

<p>, so there isn't an overflow.</p>
