<pre><code>data = []
for line in open('file.txt'):
  data.append(tuple(line.strip().split(':')))
</code></pre>

<p>The 'tuple' is only there to change the list returned by split to a tuple.</p>

<p>Optionally do:</p>

<pre><code>data = dict(data)
</code></pre>

<p>afterward to change it into a word:description dictionary, which may be a better representation of what you want.</p>
