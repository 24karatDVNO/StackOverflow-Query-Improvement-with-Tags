<p>Holy crap a frameset of framesets. What is this I don't even...</p>

<p>I think the browsers are having a heart attack and imploding. Refreshing it several times in firefox results in random rearrangement of frames, likely because they are not loading in a good sequence. </p>

<p>Try giving each frame an exact size rather than using the wildcard * for frame widths/heights and seeing if you can center things using % values or CSS (or maybe an iframe centered on the page).</p>

<p>Or better yet stop trying to tear a hole in the fabric of the internet.</p>
