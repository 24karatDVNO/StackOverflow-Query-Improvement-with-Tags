<p>I would do these things:</p>

<p>Single step the code in debug mode to make sure you are writing without an error.</p>

<p>Grab something that can read an SQLLite db and open the database to make sure you are writing the data to it.</p>

<p>Make sure you are not creating a new database with every run of your application.</p>
