<p>The position <code>4294967295</code> isn't a garbage number, it's consistent with what happens if you store a negative number in an unsigned type such as <code>size_t</code>. This would be returned by <code>find</code> if the substring <code>MAC</code> can't be found. So it probably means there's an invisible character inside the substring <code>MAC</code>. You might try iterating through the string in an encoding-specific way, and appending characters to a new string (or <code>std::vector&lt;char&gt;</code>) only if they're expected characters (i.e. letters, digits, etc.), then finding <code>MAC</code> within that.</p>
