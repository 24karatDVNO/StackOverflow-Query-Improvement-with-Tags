<p>If you use a low dpi screen on your emulator, it may appear as though it is doing nothing. On a higher dpi screen, you see what looks like DOS characters saying "ANDROID" as it loads some background things. After a while, it will start loading the OS, and then you will see a logo on screen for any sized screen.</p>

<p>Don't know about the dual-cores, sorry.</p>
