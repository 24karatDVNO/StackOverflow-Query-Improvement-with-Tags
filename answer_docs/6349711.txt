<p>Did you accidentally refactor mx:Image to s:Image in your Flex 3 to Flex 4.5 migration?</p>

<p>For Spark Image, it could be that you need to reference the symbol name in the SWF.</p>

<p>I find this works:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;s:Image source="@Embed(source='path.swf', symbol='name')" ...
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like a bad practice, though - unlike mx:Image which would load the SWF natively, Spark Image is intended for bitmap data.</p>
