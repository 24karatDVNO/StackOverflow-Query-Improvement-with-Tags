<p>You can also use the group by function instead of the distinct.  This allows you to include aggregate functions in your query that provide additional information.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT comment_author_email, count(1)
FROM  `wp_comments`
WHERE comment_author_email != ''
GROUP BY comment_author_email
</code></pre>

<p>This will return one row per unique comment_author_email value and the number of times it occurs.</p>
