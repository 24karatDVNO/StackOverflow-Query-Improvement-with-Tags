<p>If the calculated frequency changes when you change handset then I would expect that your code is in fact NOT fine. Have you tried a third handset and observed if the results it gives match one of the previous 2 handsets?</p>

<p>If you are looking for potentially more accurate solutions (saying a 2500Hz tone outputs 1400 seems odd to me) look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65268/music-how-do-you-analyse-the-fundamental-frequency-of-a-pcm-or-wac-sample">How do you analyse the fundamental frequency of a PCM or WAV sample?</a> for options.</p>
