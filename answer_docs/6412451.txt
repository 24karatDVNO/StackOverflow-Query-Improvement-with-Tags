<p>If some of the elements in the page are generated by javascript or otherwise modified by javascript, I've noticed (especially in IE7 and older) that the DOM model and the actual screen repaint is sometimes out of synch and does not update unless you move the cursor above the incorrect part. Unfortunately I've found no foolproof workaround. Sometimes though, adding and immediately removing an element into the dom somewhere, can cause the page to repaint...</p>

<p>Debugging IE sure is fun! ;P</p>
