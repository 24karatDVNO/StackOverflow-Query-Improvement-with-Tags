<p>I found what was causing my issue, the code was in a button_click event where the button control was inside an ajax update panel, as soon as i moved the button outside of the update panel it worked perfectly. Not sure if this is a fundamental mistake on my part or a bug with update panels so I'm off to have a read about them.</p>

<p>@Mark Storer, I appreciate now that this wasn't an ITextSharp problem, however when I wrote this I believed it to be, apologies to all for the mistake.</p>
