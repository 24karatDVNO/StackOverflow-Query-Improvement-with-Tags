<p>I don't have time to research this to understand why it doesn't work and why you are getting the error. But I do have time to show you how I do it which works great.</p>

<p>Download the Apache Mime and Commons HttpClient Jar libraries and add them to your project's Java Build Path.</p>

<pre><code>HttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
HttpGet request = new HttpGet();
request.setURI(new URI("http://www.codinggreenrobots.com"));

HttpResponse response = client.execute(request);

BufferedReader in = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(response.getEntity().getContent()));
StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer("");
String line = "";
while ((line = in.readLine()) != null) {
    sb.append(line + "\n";
}
in.close();
str_response = sb.toString();
</code></pre>

<p>Now that you have parsed the response, just turn it in a JSONObject.</p>

<pre><code>JSONObject event_object = new JSONObject(str_response);
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that works for you as well as it works for me.</p>
