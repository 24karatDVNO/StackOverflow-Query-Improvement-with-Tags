<p>I used this in my application:</p>

<p>ProgressDialog.show(Main.this, null, getText(R.string.loading), true, true);</p>

<p>Giving null and not empty string as title, and it is cancelable.</p>

<p>Where did you set the onItemClickListener, some contect may be helpful? Maybe you are call it on wrong place.</p>
