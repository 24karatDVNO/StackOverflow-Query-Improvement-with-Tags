<p>As far as i know you cannot customize the MPMediaPickerController yourself beyond of course what is stated in the <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MediaPlayer/Reference/MPMusicPlayerController_ClassReference/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008221" rel="nofollow">documentation</a>.</p>

<p>You will need to implement your own picker, using media queries (by song ,by artist, etc).</p>

<p>I suggest reading: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Audio/Conceptual/iPodLibraryAccess_Guide/UsingTheiPodLibrary/UsingTheiPodLibrary.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40008765-CH101-SW1" rel="nofollow">“Using the iPod Library”</a> in Apple's "iPod Library Access Programming Guide"</p>
