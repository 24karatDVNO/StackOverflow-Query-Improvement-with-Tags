<p>Yes, you should be able to animate a button when it is touched and for a set period of time...repeat...etc.</p>

<p>Take a look at <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/animation/Animation.html" rel="nofollow"> Animation Section</a> </p>

<p>boolean  getTransformation(long currentTime, Transformation outTransformation, float scale)<br>
Gets the transformation to apply at a specified point in time.</p>

<p>void     restrictDuration(long durationMillis)
Ensure that the duration that this animation will run is not longer than durationMillis.</p>

<p>long     getDuration()
How long this animation should last</p>

<p>int  getRepeatCount()
Defines how many times the animation should repeat.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you out. </p>
