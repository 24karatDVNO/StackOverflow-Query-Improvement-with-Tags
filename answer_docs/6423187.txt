<p>This is just looping through y from 1 to "1 less than x". Within an outer loop where x is decreasing from 10 down to 1.</p>

<pre><code>int x, y;  //Declare 2 integers x and y.

for(x = 10; x &gt;= 1; x--)      //Loop through values of x starting with 10 then decrease by 1 until x = 1. Each time do the following:
{          
    for(y = 1; y &lt; x; y++)  //Loop through values for y starting at 1 and going to 1 less than the x from the line above. Each time do the following:            
    {
        printf("%d", y);  // Print the value of y as a decimal integer               
    }   
    printf("\n");      //Print a carriage return. i.e. start a new line after this.
}

system("pause");  //Wait so you can see the output until you type a key.

return 0; //When this program is run it will return a value of 0 to whereever it was called from.
