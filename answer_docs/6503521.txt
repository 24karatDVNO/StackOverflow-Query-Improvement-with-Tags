<p>Natively Android supports java.sql package, to connect with sql server , mysql or oracle, you required JDBC Type-3/4 driver. as per my knowledge currently available drivers are not compatible with Android. If you found any compatible driver then it is not advisable to use it because JDBC driver are optimized to work in LAN, Not WAN (Internet). the possible option is to create web service which act as bridge between Android and Database</p>

<p>Andorid &lt;====> Web Service &lt;====> Database</p>

<p>I hope it will help you to solve your problem,</p>

<p>Best,
