<p>Turnes out, that sphinx does have facetted search feature. It has similar features of a "linguistic" pipeline, distributed search, tokenization etc as the ones in Apache SOLR/Lucene. It is an interesting option to Apache SOLR in the sense, that it is written in C++, yet is language independent on client side, same way as SOLR. It is OS as SOLR/Lucene, so customizing code is possible.</p>
