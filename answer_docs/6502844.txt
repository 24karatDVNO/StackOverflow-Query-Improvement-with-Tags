<p>There is a slight difference, which does not affect the behaviour of the map. In both cases, if you try to <em>get</em> the value for integer 5, the map will return that basic row.</p>

<p>The difference: the second line will always create a new instance of <code>Integer</code> while the first one may insert an existing instance. But maps compare by <em>equality</em>, not by <em>identity</em>, so it actually doesn't matter. Just that the first line has a (very) small postive impact on memory consumption.</p>
