<p>You can download the XPS Essentials Pack for server 2003, which includes the XPS driver from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11816" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=11816</a></p>

<p>If your server is 2000 then it won't work however the error message hints any driver will work. Open the Printers folder and from the File menu select Server Properties, go t the Drivers tab and add any PostScript driver. I'm guessing the component is relying on having a printer driver installed to get font widths.</p>
