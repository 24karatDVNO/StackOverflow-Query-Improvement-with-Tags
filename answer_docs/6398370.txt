<p>I was successful using <a href="http://modestmaps.com/" rel="nofollow">modestmaps</a> for <a href="http://processing.org/learning/eclipse/" rel="nofollow">Processing</a> (find it <a href="http://www.tom-carden.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/modest_maps_interactive.zip" rel="nofollow">here</a>). A processing PApplet can be embedded in a swing GUI as explained <a href="http://forum.processing.org/topic/how-to-embed-processing-into-java-awt-based-gui" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I guess you could use the source to draw your graph in processing and then use the already implemented 'slippy map' features.</p>
