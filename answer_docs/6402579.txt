<p>Answer depends on what do u want to achive. u can use <code>TryParse</code> method to get parsed value and information if parsing was sucesful, it there was error u can do something appropriate to the situation like return 0 as value of Textbox. Other thing u can do is suround the code u have with <code>try cach</code> and do something when exception is thrown. </p>
