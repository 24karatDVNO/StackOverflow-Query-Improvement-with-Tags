<p>When using facebook android sdk with SingleSignOn (SSO), the access token format actually changed.
Instead of getting traditional auth token which contains userid &amp; session key as a part of authToken 
now we get a different format of authToken</p>

<p>As Facebook Devs are still in process to support there rest apis with newly formated access token
meanwhile we can disable the SSO on android facebook sdk by changing DEFAULT_AUTH_ACTIVITY_CODE to -1 from 32665 (in Facebook.java)
This will invoke Traditional dialouge for granting acess token and in return you'll get access token which will contain session key in it.</p>

<p>Those who are looking for generating secure session key you need to add your own method in Facebook.java like</p>

<p>public String getSessionSecret(String accessToken) throws MalformedURLException, IOException 
{
    Bundle b = new Bundle();
    b.putString("method", "auth.promoteSession");
    b.putString("access_token", accessToken);
    b.putString("session_key_only", "true");
    String response = request(b);
    return response;
}</p>
