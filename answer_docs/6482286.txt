<p>You could iterate through each form (in my example I assume they all have the same class). By default the button value is set to "Join" and if something is checked i.e. they are a member already (something == true) it would change the value to "Leave".</p>

<p>This is a really basic example but may give you some direction.</p>

<pre><code>$('.organization').each(function() {
    if (something == true) {
       $(this).find('input[type="submit"]').attr('value', 'Leave');
    }
});
</code></pre>
