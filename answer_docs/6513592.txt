<p>This is difficult to do with regex (at least only one). In the regex you are giving the fields an order, so the parser expects them in that order.</p>

<p>One alternative would be to use a choice, but that would make difficult to check that you have one of each of the terms:</p>

<pre><code>[\w|\d|\W]{4,}
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to use regex, check three of them:</p>

<p>1) Is there a digit?</p>

<p>2) Is there a character?</p>

<p>3) Is there a special?</p>

<p>If all of them are true.... bingo!</p>
