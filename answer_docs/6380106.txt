<p>You don't need to have control over config files to extend maximum execution time. You can still use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php" rel="nofollow">set_time_limit(0)</a> on your code to make it run till the end. The only catch is if you are calling this from the browser. The browser may time-out and leave the page orphaned. I have a site which generates CSV files that take a long time and I put the process to run in the background by ending the session with the browser using buffer flush and send an email notification when the job is finished.</p>
