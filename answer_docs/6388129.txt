<p>I would say the easiest way to do this is to do lots of selects (one for each table) of the value you want to sum and just do a sum on the union of that?</p>

<p>Something like :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SUM(VALUE) FROM (
            select 1 VALUE 
            UNION
            select 2 VALUE
            UNION
            select 3 VALUE) as DATA
</code></pre>

<p>Of course the selects will be selecting a column from each table and not just an integer like this, but you get the idea ...</p>
