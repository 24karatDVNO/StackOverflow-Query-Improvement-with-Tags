<p>I suggest you to read how to design event base applications (could be Java, Android, Flash or VB.Net) and a concrete resource is the book <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/" rel="nofollow">Growing Object-Oriented Software</a>. In that book, the authors explain how to build and test a Swing application, and the design they use is perfect (from my point of view, of course).</p>
