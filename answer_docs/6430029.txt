<p>I usually get my UI in order first.  The reason?  As I prototype different designs, sometimes my idea for the app changes.  If it does, then it's no consequence - there is no code to rewrite.  </p>

<p>However, sometimes it is helpful to get the fundamentals first in order to determine if the app is going to work or not.  If it's not going to function, then why waste time making interfaces?</p>
