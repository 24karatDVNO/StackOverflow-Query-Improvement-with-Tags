<p>Note: this is more of a pointer than an answer, but I couldn't get this to work in a comment.</p>

<p>I did <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22%27NoneType%27%20object%20is%20not%20callable%22&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3aen-US%3aofficial&amp;client=firefox-a#sclient=psy&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=bd0&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3aen-US%3aofficial&amp;source=hp&amp;q=%22NoneType%27%20object%20is%20not%20callable%22%20mod_wsgi%20ignored&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.&amp;fp=f0db36aa1c9349b9&amp;biw=981&amp;bih=661" rel="nofollow">some googling on the error message</a> and there seems to be a group of related problems that crop up in Apache + mod_wsgi + MySQL environments. The culprit may be that you are running out of simultaneous connections to MySQL because of process pooling, with each process maintaining an open connection to the DB server. There are also indications that some non-thread-safe code may be used in a multi-thread environment.  Good luck.</p>
