<p>In Xcode 4, the Organizer window has a documentation section which can be accessed from the Right sidebar (Quick Help, which is part of the button group to enable the bottom bar (GDB by default) as well as the left sidebar (Class tree/etc) ) of the main Xcode window whenever you click on basically anything in the code (if its a custom method/variable it only tells you where it is defined). However, if it is something like IBAction it will pop up a brief definition as well as a link to open the previously mentioned organizer to the appropriate documentation page. </p>
