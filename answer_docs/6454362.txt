<p>As <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2297/ceejayoz">ceejayoz</a> says, your query would need to be:</p>

<pre><code>$status = $facebook-&gt;api_client-&gt;fql_query("SELECT message,time FROM 
status WHERE uid in (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1=".$user.") ORDER BY time LIMIT 1");

echo "&lt;pre&gt;";
print_r($status);
echo "&lt;/pre&gt;";
</code></pre>
