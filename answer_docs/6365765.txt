<p>First steps with any network issue are</p>

<ol>
<li>Can you PING the remote host from the local host</li>
<li>If not, the remote host is down or a firewall is blocking the two</li>
<li>If you can, can you TELNET to the relevent port on the remote host from the local</li>
<li>If not, maybe nothing is listening on that port or the firewall is blocking it</li>
<li>If you can TELNET but the remote host isn't responding to the expected connection, it may be a protocol issue (eg trying to send HTTP to a database listener)</li>
</ol>
