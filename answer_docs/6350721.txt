<p>If that's C# that you're writing, as you've commented, you'll want to start using parameters to avoid SQL injection.</p>

<pre><code>string getMember= @"SELECT member_Id FROM members 
                    WHERE member_Firstname like @userText
                    OR    member_Lastname like  @userText;";

MySqlCommand m = new MySqlCommand(getMember);
m.Parameters.AddWithValue("@userText", tbMemberName.Text + "%");

var reader = m.ExecuteReader();
</code></pre>
