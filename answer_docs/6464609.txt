<p>Regarding the double click in case of <code>DataGridCheckBoxColumn</code> and no click in case of  <code>DataGridTemplateColumn</code>, I think this is happening because inside the <code>DataGridCheckBoxColumn</code> the <code>CellTemplate</code> and  <code>EditingCellTemplate</code> would have been implemented differently. In case of <code>CellTemplate</code> it would be defined as <code>readonly</code> and once you double click you go in editing mode i.e. <code>EditingCellTemplate</code> and only then you can modify the <code>checkbox</code> and it makes sense.</p>

<p>Now in your case as you have defined both the editing and non-editing template same, so the checkbox is always ready to accept the input</p>

<p>Regarding your main question that why the <code>checkbox</code> in <code>custom template</code> mode is not following the <code>GridReadOnly</code> option, I think this is happening due to the fact that once you define <code>cell templates</code> yourself i.e. <code>cellEditing</code> template and <code>non-editing celltemplate</code> it becomes your responsibility to handle the read only behavior of cells. The option applied on the grid such as read only won't have any effect in templatedcolumn case</p>
