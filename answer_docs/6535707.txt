<p>You can do this in a single trigger.</p>

<p>Here are the two columns from your example combined into one trigger. I just did an update triggers because that's what you had in your example, but you'll probably want another trigger to do the same thing for inserts, too.</p>

<pre><code>DELIMITER $$

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS tr_b_upd_products $$

CREATE TRIGGER tr_b_upd_products BEFORE UPDATE ON products FOR EACH ROW BEGIN
  IF (NEW.sn = 0)
  THEN
    SET NEW.sn=NULL;
  END IF;

  IF (NEW.name = '')
  THEN
    SET NEW.name=NULL;
  END IF;
END $$

DELIMITER ;
</code></pre>
