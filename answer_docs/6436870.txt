<p>If the error is this:</p>

<p>550 5.7.1 Unable to relay for ragaei.mahmoud@invensys.com</p>

<p>Then your SMTP server cannot send to that email address.  Use a different SMTP server or configure it to relay out to the internet.  The local one will probably only send to addresses on your own domain.  If this is an SMTP server configuration question, you may have more luck asking on Superuser.</p>
