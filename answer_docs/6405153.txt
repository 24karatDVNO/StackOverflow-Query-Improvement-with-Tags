<p>Hmm... <a href="http://vtk.org" rel="nofollow">VTK</a> for visualization; you'll get all the interactivity you want, and 600K points doesn't sound like too much on a decent GPU (even a 4-year old NVidia 7 series or equivalent ATI should handle it).</p>

<p>As for lossless compression, I'd suggest using a binary format for your data and then just zipping it up (say, using zlib or something).</p>
