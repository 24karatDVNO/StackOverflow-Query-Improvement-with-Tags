<p><code>strcat</code> appends the second parameter to the end of the first. This means that in your case the total length of concatenation will be 11 characters, while <code>des</code> has only place enough to hold 6. Change <code>des[6]</code> to <code>des[11]</code> and your program will work fine. Also check <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cstring/strcat/" rel="nofollow">this</a> reference for more information about <code>strcat</code>.</p>
