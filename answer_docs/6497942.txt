<p>Why don't you simply keep your simple hover logic as it is (hide on mouse out) but then simply re-show it when the mouse is over the X or Y div.</p>

<pre><code>$('#openDiv').mouseout(function() {
    $(this).hide();
});

$('div.x').mousein(function() {
    $('#openDiv').show();
});
</code></pre>

<p>If you make your $('div.x') selector have an ID or at least a context that isn't the entire DOM, I bet the "flicker" from hiding then showing again isn't even noticeable.</p>
