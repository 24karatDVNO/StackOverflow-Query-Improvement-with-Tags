<p>You should have a Team object which holds data about the team. One team object for each team. It may also be useful to have a Match object where you can pass in two Team objects so they can play against each other. You can write a method outside of the Team and Match objects to auto generate the teams competing in the matches. </p>

<p>I would use an ArrayList of Team objects and then if you want random matches just generate two random numbers that would be an index in the ArrayList. You can use Math.random() or the Random class, doesn't matter. The two numbers should not be the same otherwise a team would be playing itself which doesn't make sense. You should be able to work out the algorithm in code from this.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
