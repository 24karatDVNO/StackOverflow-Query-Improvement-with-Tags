<p>You can use <code>a[b]</code> and<code>*(a+b)</code> interchangeably because that is exactly how <code>a[b]</code> is defined when one of <code>a</code> or <code>b</code> is a pointer and the other is of integer or enumeration type.</p>

<p>Note: This also means that expressions like <code>42[a]</code> are perfectly legal. Human readers might object strongly, but the compiler won't bat an eye at this. </p>
