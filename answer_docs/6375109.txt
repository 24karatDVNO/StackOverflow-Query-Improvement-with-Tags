<p>I think that errors should be handled as locally as possible. That is, if a class' method has enough knowledge to handle an error, it should do so. However, if the way to handle an error si to exit the program, I think this criterion doesn't apply. In that case, you should return back in a phased manner, like @Als says, and have a single exit point. In other cases, handle the error as locally as possible.</p>
