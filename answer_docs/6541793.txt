<p>I Google'd for various combinations of useful keywords and I came up with a few useful links to point you in the right direction. Just remember, there will not be a SINGLE, DEFINITIVE list of "correct" properties for a production environment. People will recommend things based off of their experience but you will have to try things out and use common sense to figure out what works best for you.</p>

<p>The only property I have ever had to consciously remember to change for PROD configs is the <code>hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto</code> property which will allow Hibernate to directly alter your DB's schema by automatically executing DDL statements. For test DBs, it often makes sense to use a value of "create-drop" so that the test SessionFactory will create the necessary tables for you or change existing ones to match possible, recent schema changes. On prod, you DO NOT want to let Hibernate mess with your schema. Even the Hibernate guys warn to not use this feature in a production environment because data integrity is not guaranteed. The value you should use for prod is "validate" which will simply verify that the DB you are connecting to has the correct schema your Hibernate entities map to and it will fail to load the SessionFactory if there are discrepancies.</p>
