<p>I suppose this may be the error. Whenever you install Tomcat , it starts automatically and when you make a server and run it again it Eclipse this error generates. </p>

<p>Go to control Panel --> services and stop the tom cat manually from there. </p>

<p>Then whenever you start it from eclipse the port you will found is empty so no error will be generated..</p>
