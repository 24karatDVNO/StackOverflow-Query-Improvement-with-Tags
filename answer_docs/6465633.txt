<p>You're returning three datasets. If "r" is a DataReader (unclear from your question) then you need to call;</p>

<p>r.NextResult</p>

<p>between your lines of code, like this;</p>

<pre><code>While r.Read()                    
    Dim o_email As String = CStr(r("email"))      
    r.NextResult()              
    Dim o_first_name As String = CStr(r("first_name"))  
    r.NextResult()                  
    Dim o_last_name As String = CStr(r("last_name"))
</code></pre>

<p>One other possible explanation (again, unclear) is that you messed up your first column name ("email"), this would also give an out of range exception.</p>
