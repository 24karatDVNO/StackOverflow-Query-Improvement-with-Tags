<p>Figured this out, needed to build into the ASP.NET Websites bin directory in order to get new DLL's. Changed output paths from <code>C:\Program Files\MyApp\Bin</code> to <code>C:\Program Files\MyApp\MyWebService\Bin</code>, this seemed to solve the issues I was having and the new DLL's get copied and all the debugging works.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
