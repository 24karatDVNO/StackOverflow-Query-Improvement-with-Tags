<p>I would suggest next time providing some code that indicates at least that you attempted to connect to your database first, and then if you run into trouble, someone here may be able to help. As opposed to just asking for sample code.</p>

<p>If you're talking about replication, I'm not sure this is possible from SQL Server to SQLite, otherwise, the answer to your question is simple, you would connect to your SQL Server database probably through some sort of exposed API, retrieve the data, parse it, and update your local SQLite Database accordingly.</p>

<p>Here's a link to a tutorial that covers connecting to local databases: <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/notepad/index.html" rel="nofollow">NotePad Tutorial</a></p>
