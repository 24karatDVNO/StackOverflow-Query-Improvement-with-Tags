<p>The first advantage that comes to my mind is that it executes as an interceptor, so validation logic is separated from actual action(You must be aware that interceptors are called before/after action).This makes the logic clean i.e. populate the data in separate logic, validate in different and perform  business logic in a separate one.</p>

<p>Struts2 validation could be done on both server side or client side. You have choice to use  xml, annotation or manual validation. <a href="http://struts.apache.org/2.x/docs/validation.html" rel="nofollow">This link</a> is a good place to start learning</p>
