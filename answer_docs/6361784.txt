<p>C is a good choice, IMHO.  Unlike many languages, C is generally considered "elegant" in that you have only 32 keywords, and very basic constructs (sequence, selection, iteration), with a very simple-and-consistent collection of tokens and operators.</p>

<p>Because syntax is very consistent within C (brackets and braces, blocks and statements, use of expressions), you're not marching into an unbounded world of language expansion.  C is a mature language, has weathered time nicely, and now-a-days is a "known quantity" (which is really hard to say about many other languages, even "mature" ones).</p>
