<p>Name of table is defined by mapping. Basically if you have some code which will provide correct table name to the mapping it should be <strong>theoretically</strong> possible. Practically it is wrong approach. Model must be compiled before it is used by context. In normal scenario the model is compiled only once when the context is first used and then it is internally cached and reused because compiling model is the most performance costly operation in EF (for large models it can take tens seconds) and I think it is also quite large data structure in memory. If you want to change mapping of single table per customer you need special compiled model per each customer and you must use it only for that customer. It will be difficult to handle.</p>
