<p>I did install it about a month ago. One of many errors I had to overcome was the "Invalid drive specification"</p>

<p>I've just started a blog with a <a href="http://blog.bloomingame.com/?p=3" rel="nofollow noreferrer">post</a> about installing RMagick on Win7 based on my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5811388/imagemagick-core-rl-magick-dll-not-found-or-how-to-install-rmagick-on-window">self-answered question</a> here.
One note though: I used ruby 1.9.2 and railsinstaller seem to use 1.8.7.</p>

<p>If I remember it right, this error could be caused by spaces in your image magick installation path.</p>
