<p>Blackberry currently has it in their AppWorld <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/680?lang=en" rel="nofollow">http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/680?lang=en</a></p>

<p>Nokia currently has it in their Ovi Store <a href="http://store.ovi.com/search?q=facebook" rel="nofollow">http://store.ovi.com/search?q=facebook</a></p>

<p>Saying that I don't believe there is a current "smart" phone that doesn't have a facebook app.  I didn't link it, but Palm/HP WebOS also has a facebook app.</p>

<p>To also answer the API question I saw 3rd party apps on all platforms as well so I don't believe there is a current app market/platform that doesn't support the FB API.</p>
