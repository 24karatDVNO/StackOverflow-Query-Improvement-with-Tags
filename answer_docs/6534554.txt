<p>I would set CustomersAndSitesMix up as a class with all the properties from your other two tables that you need.  I am not sure why you are needing this interface, but I would also change the return type of your method to <code>List&lt;CustomersAndSitesMix&gt;</code> and add a ToList() on the end of your LINQ query.  Then you would return an inner join of both tables, which may be what you want or you may want to add an arguement, say CustomerID to your function so you could pass it in and get only a subset.</p>
