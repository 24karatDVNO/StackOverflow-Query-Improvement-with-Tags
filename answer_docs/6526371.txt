<p>Actually, this IS possible, and you don't need to go through constant server requests. Use localStorage, and bind to the storage event. The implementation is actually really simple. The only serious gotcha is that not all browsers follow the specification for whether the storage event is fired on the origin window, but with a few lines of code you can normalize the behavior.</p>
