<p>I suggest you take a look at some MVC type of framework. They are design pattern solutions for problems just like the one you are describing.</p>

<p>The framework that I like most, because it's simple to understand and learning curve is not so steep is the <a href="http://mvvmlight.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">MVVM Light Toolkit</a>, but there is also <a href="http://compositewpf.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">PRISM</a> and <a href="http://caliburn.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Caliburn</a>.</p>

<p>They might seem a little bit more complicated, but the clarity and organization it promotes in your code will pay off in the end.</p>
