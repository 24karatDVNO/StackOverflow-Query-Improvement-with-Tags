<p>I should point out that there is a PHP serial class already available at <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/package/3679-PHP-Communicate-with-a-serial-port.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.phpclasses.org/package/3679-PHP-Communicate-with-a-serial-port.html</a>.</p>

<p>I don't know what methods it uses internally, but perhaps it will make this a bit easier to get started.</p>
