<p>I don't know if there is any Web service that return the information you are looking for. </p>

<p>The server side object model calls are SPFile.CheckOutStatus and SPFile.CheckOutType ( <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spfile_properties.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.sharepoint.spfile_properties.aspx</a> ). There are 2 types of "checked out" one when document is simply opened for editing and the other when it is explicitly checked out - you hitting the first one.</p>
