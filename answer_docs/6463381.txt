<p>I decided to go with a simple solution:</p>

<p>First, insert the row to the innodb table (master). Then, right after it, insert the row to the myisam table (not trigger).</p>

<p>Run a cron ever hour or so to ensure referential integrity.</p>

<p>The query would be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM master 
WHERE master.ID NOT IN 
    (SELECT slave.ID FROM slave WHERE master.ID=slave.ID);

SELECT * 
FROM slave 
WHERE slave.ID NOT IN 
    (SELECT master.ID FROM master WHERE slave.ID=master.ID);
</code></pre>

<p>If a slave row refers to a master row that does not exist, delete.</p>

<p>If a slave row does not exist for a master row, insert.</p>

<p>It's not the best solution, but simple.</p>
