<p>The best way to determine the desired sorting expression would be to let some human beings sort some items manually and deduce the expressions from their answers. It may well be that different persons would give different answers, so that one single expression can't accommodate everyone.</p>

<p>There are other useful polynomial expressions such as <code>t*d + A*t + B*d</code>, where <code>t</code> and <code>d</code> are time and distance. Maybe more precise results can be achieved if we introduce one more polynomial degree, so that expression becomes <code>t*d + A*t*t + B*d*d + C*t + D*d</code>. Only from answers of real humans can you devise this formula.</p>
