<p>Ah.. Ok.. I don't think you actually have a problem.</p>

<p>From their specifications <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z714w2y9.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>, they state that "AntiAlias and HighQuality are equivalent and specify rendering with smoothing applied."</p>

<p>Internally I think it only maintains the "none" or "anti-aliased" values. </p>
