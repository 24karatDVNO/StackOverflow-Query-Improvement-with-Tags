<p><a href="http://www.exceltip.com/st/Basic_file_and_folder_examples_using_VBA_in_Microsoft_Excel/443.html" rel="nofollow">Dir()</a> will help you determine if a file exists already.</p>

<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.office.tools.excel.workbook.saveas%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">Workbook.SaveAs()</a> will help you save the file out.</p>

<p>You'll need to concatenate your strings together with the <code>&amp;</code> operator (to add on the <code>V1</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>

<p>Thanks for posting what you have.  I came up with</p>

<pre><code>Sub SaveNumberedFile()

    Static count As Integer
    Dim filestr As String
    filestr = "C:\Users\Me\Documents\Code\TestWkbk"
    ThisWorkbook.Activate 'Activate whichever workbook you need
    If count = 0 Then
        ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs (filestr &amp; ".xls")

    ElseIf count &gt; 0 And Dir(filestr &amp; "v" &amp; count - 1 &amp; ".xls") = "" Then
        ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs (filestr &amp; "v" &amp; count &amp; ".xls")
    End If

    count = count + 1

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>I used a static variable to keep track of the numbers.  This will retain the value of <code>count</code> between calls to the macro.  It will not keep track of <code>count</code> after you close the workbook.  In that situation, you can check to see what the last file number was using the <code>Dir()</code> command, and initialize the static variable to that value.  </p>

<p>I did not add all of the frills to the <code>SaveAs</code> command, but you seem to know which ones you need.</p>

<p>Try it out, it may need some tweaking.  </p>
