<p>C++ does not have any standard facilities for drawing graphics in a console application.  Any features (like changing the font color) will depend on your OS.  I doubt you will find functions that do much more than changing the text color though.  (For example, on Windows you would use system("color xx") to change the foreground and background color.)</p>

<p>Basically, if you want graphics you're going to have to abandon the console application and look for a graphics API.</p>
