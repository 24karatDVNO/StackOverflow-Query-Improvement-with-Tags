<p>In order to use the source package you must compile the code in release mode before attempting to access the website.</p>

<p>Being new to DNN, I recommend starting with the install package which will not need compiled, or even easier, you can get DNN through the Microsoft Web Platform Installer.  WPI will also take care of all the dependnacies that may need configured on your computer.</p>
