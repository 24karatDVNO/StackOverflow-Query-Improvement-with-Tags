<p>Shouldn't the second bit of example 1 be "rowname1"..etc.? I don't really get example 2 so I guess I would aim you towards 1. There is much to be said for having data immediately workable without pre-processing it first. Justification: I once spend too long optimizing array system that turned out to work perfectly but its hell to update it now.</p>
