<p>This should give you a way to call a subroutine the connects for you. You would pass in the parameters required.</p>

<pre><code>Sub adocnnRoutine_SP(ByVal ReturnVal As String, ByVal cnnstr As String, ByVal CallVal   As Range, Optional CallHDR As Range)
'ReturnValue is the string to send to SQL Such as "Select * from TableName where email    = 'username@email.com'"
'CallVal places the results in that one cell as a starting point Such as Sheet2.Range("A2")
'CallHDR is optional header placement point Such as Sheet2.Range("A1")


Dim cn As ADODB.Connection, rs As ADODB.RECORDSET

Set cn = New ADODB.Connection
Set rs = New ADODB.RECORDSET

On Error GoTo CleanUp
cn.Open cnnstr
rs.Open ReturnVal, cnnstr



 If Not CallHDR Is Nothing Then

 With CallHDR
    For Each field In rs.Fields
      .Offset(0, Offset).Value = field.Name
      Offset = Offset + 1
    Next field
  End With

 End If

CallVal.CopyFromRecordset rs

CleanUp:


Debug.Print Err.Description

cn.Close
Set rs = Nothing
Set cn = Nothing



End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>And Then you can loop through your sheet1 emails as required.</p>
