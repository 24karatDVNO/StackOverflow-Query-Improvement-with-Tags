<p>I solved my issue with the following method :</p>

<p>I added a custom field in my Article linq class called firstReference, I then altered my linq query so it now look like this :</p>

<pre><code>            var articlesQuery = from art in QueryDataContext.Article
                                join artSup in QueryDataContext.ArticleSupplier on art.uid equals artSup.uidArticle
                                            select new
                                            {
                                                Article = art,

                                                firstSupplierUid = artSup.uid,
                                                firstReference = artSup.reference,
                                                firstFormat = artSup.format,
                                            };
</code></pre>

<p>And in my XAML binding, instead of binding on "ArticleSupplier[0].reference" I simply bind on "firstReference".</p>

<p>It seem to do the job pretty well.</p>
