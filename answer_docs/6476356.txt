<p>can you telnet to post 1433 on the sql server box?</p>

<p>try this in the command line from your local iis box:</p>

<pre><code>telnet servername 1433
</code></pre>

<p>If it doesn't connect through the command line, then you will need to open security ports to the sql box.</p>

<p>If it connects fine, then you might want to check your connection string settings.
Can you provide your web.config if this is the case.</p>
