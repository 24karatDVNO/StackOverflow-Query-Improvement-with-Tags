<p>As far as I can understand you're trying to execute multiple statements, right?<br>
You should separate your SQL statements with a semicolon and change the reader when you've finished with the previous <a href="http://www.developerfusion.com/code/4638/how-to-run-through-multiple-datareader-results/" rel="nofollow">one</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I usually use stored procedures and return parameters for counters.
Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE PROCEDURE usp_GetUsers (@sid INT, @unpublished INT OUTPUT)

AS
BEGIN

DECLARE @total_drafts INT
DECLARE @unpublished_drafts INT;

SELECT @total_drafts = count (1) FROM users WHERE version_replace = @sid 
SELECT @unpublished_drafts = count (1) FROM users WHERE version_replace = @sid AND moderated = 0 

SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = @sid ORDER By ID DESC

    RETURN(@total_drafts)

END
</code></pre>
