<p>I've gone back and tested and re-tested this, it appears that the only way I can get it to work (since I have some files in the img folder and some in js/css, etc...)  is not to use a relative path to my image in the html and have everything referenced to the bundle folder.  What a shame :(.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="myimage.png" /&gt;
</code></pre>
