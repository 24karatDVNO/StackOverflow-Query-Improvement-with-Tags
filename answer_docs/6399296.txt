<p>You just have to create the new jar file the same way you would create a zip file (ex. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4914750/how-to-zip-a-whole-folder-using-php">Here</a> )</p>

<p>If your jar archive is signed, beware that code signing verification fails if content is modified.</p>
