<p>I can speak for Solaris here, in that it uses an OS timer to wake up sleep calls. By default the minimum wait time will be 10ms, regardless of what you specify in your <code>usleep</code>. However, you can use the parameters <code>hires_tick = 1</code> (1ms wakeups) and <code>hires_hz =</code> in the <code>/etc/system</code> configuration file to increase the frequency of timer wake up calls.</p>
