<p>I've figured it out, too bad I did not concentrate on the CSS part of my application sooner. I am using the GridFilters extenstion and it comes with GridFilters.css file. In my version, line number 46->48 which is this:</p>

<pre><code>li.x-menu-list-item div {
    display: inline;
}
</code></pre>

<p>got me in trouble, overriding the month/year menu's position. Really thought that it's one of my JS scripts that is causing this because it has been working for months like this and suddently the month/year chooser stopped working.</p>

<p>It's all good now, I've commented out those lines and gridfilters are also working/displaying as it should. </p>

<p>Thanks for the interest.</p>
