<p>You distinguish retina and non-retina images only by their name ending like:
picture.png for normal
picture@2x.png for retina
I usually put them into the same folder so i can easily see what pictures have retina support.</p>

<p>Using [UIImage imageNamed:@"picture.png"] will at first try and load picture@2x.png if your app runs on a device with retina display. If it cannot load the 2x version, it will use the picture.png.</p>
