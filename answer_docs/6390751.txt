<p>Maybee not the best solution, but it works:</p>

<pre><code>DELETE FROM form_options_info, form_options, forms
  USING forms INNER JOIN form_options INNER JOIN form_options_info
  WHERE (form_options_info.form_options_id = form_options.id 
    AND form_options.form_id = forms.id
    OR form_options.form_id = forms.id)
    AND forms.id = 2;
</code></pre>

<p>...or just change the tables to InnoDB ;-)...</p>
