<p>EDIT: nevermind, my algorithm for finding the point of collision is incorrect. I'll think about this a bit more.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Ok, sorry about that. Try this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find out when they collided. Let's call this T seconds ago. This would be T such that the distance between the two balls is equal to the sum of their radii. The equation is ((x1 - v_x1*T)-(x2 - v_x2*T))^2 = r1 + r2</li>
<li>Move the balls back time T</li>
<li>Continue with the your collision</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm sorry, I don't know how to format math equations on SO. :S</p>

<p>After going back to the time of collision, you can calculate their new velocities fairly easily using elementary physics.
