<p>The date calculation piece isn't so much jQuery as it is native JavaScript.</p>

<p>You are on the right track with timestamps. In my opinion, the most straightforward way is to compare timestamps by doing the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Subtract currentDate from maxDate</li>
<li>See if the difference is less than 30 days</li>
</ul>
