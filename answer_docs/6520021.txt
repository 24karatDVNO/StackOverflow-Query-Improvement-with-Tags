<p>as per your given example you have EFF_DATE and ACCT_DATE in formated form only so i think you can directly join basis of these two columns</p>

<p>like - </p>

<pre><code>select st.*,ft.rate from first_table ft, second_table st
where st.acct_date=ft.eff_date
</code></pre>

<p>but this will not give your desired output what you have mentioned in you question...</p>

<p>do you really want to join with acct_date???</p>

<p>and if you want to just join without this type of condition then better mention that condition and update your question </p>
