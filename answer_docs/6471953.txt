<p>This will get urls from url() (css), href and src attributes (links, imgs, scripts):</p>

<pre><code>#(?:href|src)="([^"]+)|url\(["']?(.*?)["']?\)#i
</code></pre>

<p>They will be captured in group 1 and 2.
Be aware that some urls can be relative, so you have to make them absolute before calling them.</p>
