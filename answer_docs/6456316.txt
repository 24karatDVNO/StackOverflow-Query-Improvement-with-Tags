<p>Let me get this straight... </p>

<ol>
<li>Running a query the first time is slower than the second time,</li>
<li>When your query returns more records it takes longer and</li>
<li>When you search for more keywords (increasing the complexity of the filter) it takes longer</li>
</ol>

<p>Am i getting that right?</p>

<p>If so they all sound like pretty normal behaviours to me.</p>

<ol>
<li>MSSQL does caching of some sort so subsequent runs of the same query will be faster</li>
<li>The more records returned, the longer it takes to move the data from SQL server to your machine</li>
<li>The more complex the query/conditions the longer it'll take to run</li>
</ol>
