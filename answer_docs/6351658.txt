<p>I found a solution using a tool called selenium. I am able to easily click through the gwt application record my activity within the application for future use, and get the actual html  generated by the application which I can then parse for desired content and act accordingly. The only small drawback is that selenium does require the use of a browser, unlike htmlunit or httpunit.</p>
