<p>The basic recommendation is to use jqTouch instead, although it's a bit of a bloated library. <a href="http://zeptojs.com/" rel="nofollow">http://zeptojs.com/</a> may be better, although it doesn't specifically have a touch-hold-drag function.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gotproject.com/blog/post2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotproject.com/blog/post2.html</a> and <a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4" rel="nofollow">http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4</a> may be helpful too. </p>

<p>But really, draggable is not something touch devices are designed for, and your users may not understand what to do unless you explicitly tell them.</p>
