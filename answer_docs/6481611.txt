<p>Sadly, no. You have to implement all of that yourself. I spent a great deal of time in the Advanced Text lab while at WWDC, bugging the guys who wrote most of Core Text. There are some odd bits where system functionality shines though, if you use a label to do some of the drawing. But in the current SDK, we are out of luck.</p>
