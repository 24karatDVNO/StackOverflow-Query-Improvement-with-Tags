  <p>If you want full, CSS-controlled print
  headers and footers, you'll need to
  wait until browsers implement support
  for the CSS3 Paged Media Candidate
  Recommendation. It explicitly provides
  for the facility but in a quite
  different way, using margin boxes.</p>

<p>probably because...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>... the CSS
  description of position: fixed, [is] namely
  "... In the case of the print media
  type, the box is rendered on every
  page, and is fixed with respect to the
  page ..." [Section 9.3.1]</p>

<p>...but the article says it doesn't work as of these days.</p>

<p><strong>BUT</strong>, to help you, later the article says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Setting a top margin on body (for
  example) will work only for the first
  page.</p>
