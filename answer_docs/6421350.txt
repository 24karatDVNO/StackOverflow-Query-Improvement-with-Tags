<p>It's always best to keep your controllers as light as possible so I'd go for separate controllers for each.  You might want to take a look at the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2011/05/05/ef-code-first-and-data-scaffolding-with-the-asp-net-mvc-3-tools-update.aspx" rel="nofollow">MVC Controller Scaffolding</a> feature which is now more easily available in the MVC 3 Tools Update. It's perfect for this kind of "basic" CRUD work.  </p>
