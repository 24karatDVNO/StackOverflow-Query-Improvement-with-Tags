<p>Come to find out (after a VERY long process of trial and error), there's a little something everybody should know about.</p>

<p>You cannot copy </p>

<pre><code>&lt;ToolkitScriptManager&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>code from one aspx page to another. You MUST drag it from the toolbox onto your page. I guess it does some stuff we don't see or know about. Same probably goes for ModalPopupExtender.</p>

<p>Hope that helps somebody out there!</p>
