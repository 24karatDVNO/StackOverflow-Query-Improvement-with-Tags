<p>I think you're going to need to show us some code to see exactly what your problem is. I worked up a quick example of using the <code>WebBrowser</code> control with one HTML file that links to the other and its working just as expected.</p>

<p>Relative links are relative to the current document being browsed. If you're writing raw HTML to the browser then I think that links a relative to what it thinks is root which might be <code>file:///c:/</code> but I'm not sure. Also, you might be running into a permission problem if you're files are actually living in the drive's root.</p>

<p>Here's the sample that's working fine for me:</p>

<pre><code>Option Strict On
Option Explicit On

Imports System.IO

Public Class Form1

    Private WithEvents WebB As WebBrowser

    Private Sub Form1_Load(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles MyBase.Load
        ''//Create our web browser
        Me.WebB = New WebBrowser()
        ''//Set it to fill the form
        Me.WebB.Dock = DockStyle.Fill
        ''//Add it to the form
        Me.Controls.Add(Me.WebB)

        ''//We will put our HTML files in this folder which is on the desktop
        Dim WorkingFolder = Path.Combine(My.Computer.FileSystem.SpecialDirectories.Desktop, "HTMLTest")
        ''//Create it if it doesn't exist
        If Not Directory.Exists(WorkingFolder) Then Directory.CreateDirectory(WorkingFolder)

        ''//The names of the two files that we are creating
        Dim FirstFile = "Start.html"
        Dim SecondFile = "End.html"

        ''//Write HTML in the first file that has a link to the second file
        My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(WorkingFolder, FirstFile), &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Start&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;a href=&lt;%= SecondFile %&gt;&gt;Link to second file&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;.ToString(), False)
        ''//Write HTML in the second file
        My.Computer.FileSystem.WriteAllText(Path.Combine(WorkingFolder, SecondFile), &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;End&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;This is the second file&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;.ToString(), False)

        ''//Tell the web browser to navigate to the second file
        Me.WebB.Navigate(Path.Combine(WorkingFolder, FirstFile))
    End Sub
End Class
