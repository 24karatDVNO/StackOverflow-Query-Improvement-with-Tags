<p>In addition to the formats suggested by others here (CSV, XML, JSON, etc.) you might consider storing the info in a Java properties file. (See the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html#load%28java.io.InputStream%29" rel="nofollow"><code>java.util.Properties</code></a> class.) The code is already there for you, so all you have to figure out is the properties names (or name prefixes) you want to use.</p>

<p>The <code>Properties</code> class also provides for storing/loading properties in a simple XML format.</p>
