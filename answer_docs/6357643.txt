<p>after looking at Ray K. sample i was able to form the following which i think flows with how the rest of my dropdown boxes are displayed: </p>

<pre><code>viewModel.Status = new[]
                               {
                                   new SelectListItem {Text = "All", Value = "0"},
                                   new SelectListItem {Text = "Open", Value = "1"},
                                   new SelectListItem {Text = "Closed", Value = "2"},
                               };
        return viewData;
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks again Ray K. </p>
