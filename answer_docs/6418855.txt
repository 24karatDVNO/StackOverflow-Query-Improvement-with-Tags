<p>There are two solutions, depending on whether you want the two counts in separate rows or in separate columns.</p>

<p>In separate rows:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT datecreated, recordtype, COUNT(*)
FROM tbl_customers
WHERE datecreated BETWEEN '...' AND '...'
GROUP BY datecreated, recordtype
</code></pre>

<p>In separate colums (this is called <em>pivoting</em> the table)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT datecreated,
       SUM(recordtype = 'C') AS count_customers,
       SUM(recordtype = 'L') AS count_leads
FROM tbl_customers
WHERE datecreated BETWEEN '...' AND '...'
GROUP BY datecreated
</code></pre>
