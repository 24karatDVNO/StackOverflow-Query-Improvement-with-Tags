<p>I believe you want a global variable $GLOBAL:variable_name. That variable will be in the scope of the script not just the function.</p>

<p>Looking at the code you may want to use trap (<code>Get-Help about_Trap</code>) as well - though $GLOBAL:variable_name would work with yours above. Here's a re-wreite of the code example - I've not tested this so it's more pseudo-code... :)</p>

<pre><code>function MyFun {
  [CmdletBinding()]    # must be an advanced function or this 
  param ()             # will not work as ErrorVariable will not exist
  begin {
    trap {
      $GLOBAL:my_error_boolean = $true
      $GLOBAL:my_error_message = "Error Message?"

      return
    }
  }
  process {
    # more code here....
  }
}

# call the function
$GLOBAL:my_error_boolean = $false
MyFun 
# this check would be similar to checking if $? -eq $false
if ($GLOBAL:my_error_boolean) {
  "An error was detected"
  # handle error, log/email contents of $Err, etc.
}
</code></pre>

<p>HTH, Matt</p>
