<p>Try the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b" rel="nofollow">GLFW-b</a> bindings instead.  I've worked with the author of GLFW-b to make all the necessary changes to get 2.7 working on OSX.  It even works in GHCI.</p>

<p>You can <code>cabal install nehe-tuts</code> to see a demo of it working.</p>
