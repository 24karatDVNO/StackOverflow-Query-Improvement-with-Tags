<p>Same effect, but Codeigniter-style:</p>

<pre><code>//remember that custom routes need to go _after_ ci's default routes, as they're executed in the order you provide them
$route['default_controller'] = "welcome";
$route['404_override'] = '';
//exception 1 to your regex here
//exception 2 to your regex here
//so on...
$route['(:any)/(:any)/(:any)'] = "$2/$3/$1";
</code></pre>
