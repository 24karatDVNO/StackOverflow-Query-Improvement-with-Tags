<p>I think this might be what you want:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT venuename
  FROM (SELECT venuename, costperday, MIN(costperday) OVER () mincost
          FROM venues
         WHERE venuecapacity &gt;= 120) q
 WHERE q.costperday = q.mincost;
</code></pre>

<p>Use >= 120, because you might not have any venues that have exactly 120 capacity, and you want all venues that can handle <em>at least</em> 120. Your requirements only state that the venue be able to accommodate 120 people, not that it handle exactly 120 people.</p>
