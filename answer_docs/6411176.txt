<p>The issue was resolved by having the <code>UIButton</code> outside the <code>scrollview</code>.</p>

<p>Done with the following lines...</p>

<pre><code>UIScrollView *scrollView = [[UIScrollView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0 , 0, appFrame.size.width, appFrame.size.height-100)];

scrollView.contentSize = CGSizeMake(appFrame.size.width, appFrame.size.height+however_big_area_i_needed);
</code></pre>

<p>The button was made using IB.</p>
