<p>You should be able to set the <code>OCAMLLIB</code> environment variable to get the result you're looking for.  This is documented to help <code>ocamlrun</code> find the <code>ld.conf</code> file you noted in your question, but might also help you with <code>ocamlc</code>.  The core distribution of OCaml doesn't have a configuration file for library paths, only the config file for locating C libraries.</p>
