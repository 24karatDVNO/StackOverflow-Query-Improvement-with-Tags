<p>As the error says: there's nothing wrong with your <code>SELECT</code> statements, but there's something wrong with your general <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms190306%28SQL.90%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">SET ARITHABORT setting</a>. </p>

<p>As <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd171921%28SQL.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">this article on TechNet</a> explains, for an indexed view or XML data type methods, you need to have <code>SET ARITHABORT ON</code>. So put that statement before yours and you should be fine.</p>
