<p>Another way is to duplicate attributes in child tables and make parent table as VIEW (that selects by common attributes from all children).</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW Parent
AS 
SELECT ID, Name FROM Child1
UNION ALL
SELECT ID, Name FROM Child2 ...
</code></pre>

<p>The problem could be with ID that should be unique through all the child tables (using GUIDs is preferrable)</p>
