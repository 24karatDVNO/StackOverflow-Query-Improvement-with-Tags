<p>I felt like this was a common problem, so I wrote some code to help out with it.  You can add what your getter is dependent on in the Bindable metadata.  So:</p>

<p>[Bindable(event="derivedChanged",dependentProperty="a")]
 [Bindable(event="derivedChanged",dependentProperty="b")]
 public function get derived():int
 {
     return a+b;
 }</p>

<p>It's custom code, written to use Parsley's metadata processing, but you could use it without Parsley--it just would be a normal method call and wouldn't look as nice.</p>
