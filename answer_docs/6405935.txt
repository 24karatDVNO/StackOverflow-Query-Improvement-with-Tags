<p>You need to consider what you are exactly looking for. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Are you looking to filter dates older than a week? You can do that comparison on the SQL and you don't burden PHP with date comparisons.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you wanting a date difference? Again, I suggest putting it in SQL and just display the result.</p></li>
</ul>
