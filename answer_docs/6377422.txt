<p>You might have conflicting installations of ruby. One with the proper gem which you are using in the shell but one the server is using which doesn't have it installed properly.</p>

<p>I would check your environment variables to see if there is a conflict.</p>

<p>This can also happen if you are using RVM and have switched to a different version/gemset than the default one.</p>
