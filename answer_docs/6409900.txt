<p>You can't, Errors from the R.java class are caused by two reasons:<br>
1.project properties are broken.<br>
2.errors that come from xml files.</p>

<p>for the first issue you can do:<br>
right click on the project > Android Tools > Fix Project Properties<br>
restart eclipse / Project > Clean</p>

<p>Errors that shown in xml files are from the ADT.<br>
ADT error information can be found in:<br>
Eclipse > Window > Show View > Error Log .</p>
