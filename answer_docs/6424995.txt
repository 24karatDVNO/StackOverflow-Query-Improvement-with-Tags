<p>I haven't worked with the <code>rlextra</code> module before, but what's happening is that, as far as I know, no part of ReportLab is really designed to append to an existing file.  Instead what you need to do is generate these two images (if you want to avoid writing them to an actual file, consider using <code>StringIO</code>) and then draw them together on a single canvas.</p>
