<p>iOS devices fall into following categories for performance:</p>

    iPhone, iPhone 3G, iPod Touch 1G: 412MHz, 128MB RAM
    iPod Touch 2G:                    533MHz, 128MB RAM
    iPhone 3GS, iPod Touch 3G:        600MHz, 256MB RAM
    iPod Touch 4G:                    800MHz, 256MB RAM
    iPhone 4:                         800MHz, 512MB RAM
    iPhone 4S:              Dual-Core 800MHz, 512MB RAM

<p>It would probably be beneficial to have as many of these categories covered as possible, especially if you want enable/disable certain things to optimize graphics/performance for each device.  At minimum, I would suggest getting a device in that first group so you can make sure your game can run on the least powerful hardware.</p>

<p>I would also suggest getting an iPhone 4 in order to have Retina Display graphics.  Retina Display graphics are generally expected in new games these days, and although you could test it in the simulator, I would suggest having an iPhone 4 handy to test it on a real device as well.</p>
