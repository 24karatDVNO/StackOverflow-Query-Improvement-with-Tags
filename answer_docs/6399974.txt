<p>You could include a "friends of friends" field. It would be a very big table (say, 200*200*N = 40,000*N ... or really huge if you have no limit to friends, and someone is friends with a million people - that's 1 million people with 1 million FoF) but it would be easier than hitting the database 200 times per view.</p>
