<p>I'm on the PushButton Engine team, and to be clear... the problem isn't PushButton Engine. There is a bug in the Adobe Flex SDK 4.5 which breaks the ResourceManager inside of PushButton Engine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Iâ€™ve run into a bug with the released version of the Adobe Flex 4.5 SDK. The 4.5 version of the SDK does not respect keeping [Embed] metadata in your SWF. This is problematic because we use this metadata extensively in PushButton Engine.</p>

<p>The bug is currently under investigation at Adobe:
