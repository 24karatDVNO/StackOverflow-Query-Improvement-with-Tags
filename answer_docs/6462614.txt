<p>Starting with release 9.7, DB2 for Linux, UNIX, and Windows now supports a wide variety of Oracle functions, data types (NUMBER, VARCHAR2, DATE that includes a timestamp, to name a few), and also introduces PL/SQL compatibility. The goal of these features is to help accelerate and simplify the task of migrating applications from Oracle to DB2. IBM even provides a compatibility analysis tool called MEET DB2 that will scan an extract of your Oracle DDL (including PL/SQL packages) to produce a report that highlights the areas that may require some manual adjustment to work in DB2. When the DB2_COMPATIBILITY_VECTOR is set to ORA, it is not uncommon for over 90% of the original Oracle code to function properly as-is.</p>
