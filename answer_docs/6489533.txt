<p>If you move to <strong>Delphi 7</strong> your options improve...</p>

<p>The Delphi 7 WSDL Importer (wsdlimp.exe) has an update that can be downloaded from Embarcadero <a href="http://cc.embarcadero.com/Item/24535" rel="nofollow">ID: 24535, Delphi SOAP Runtime and Importer Update</a></p>

<p>Although it doesn't say that Delphi 6 is supported (could be technical or marketing reasons behind that), you could try using the downloaded wsdlimp.exe from the command line and then try the generated .pas file with your Delphi 6 project anyway.</p>
