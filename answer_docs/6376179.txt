<p>It was the fact that there was a search form in the footer tag - Network Solutions creates a form, container, and table to put the whole page in, so the search form that was part of the page I imported from WordPress wouldn't work (you can't have a form within a form). That is what IE objected to. The nested form caused all the footer tags to go haywire in DW, but DW didn't highlight the form as being a problem at all, just all the divs around it...</p>

<p>Thanks kinakuta for your help.</p>
