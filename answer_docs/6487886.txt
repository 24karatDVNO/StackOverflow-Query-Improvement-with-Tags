<p>I recommend you to install Paperclip as a gem, not as a plugin. Installing as a plugin can lead to all sorts of issues.  </p>

<p>GitHub paperclip sites states specifically:<br/><br/>
<strong>"Paperclip is distributed as a gem, which is how it should be used in your app. It's technically still installable as a plugin, but that's discouraged, as Rails plays well with gems."</strong></p>

<p>Visit <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip" rel="nofollow">GitHub/Paperclip</a> and install Paperclip as a gem and you should be fine. </p>
