<p>For data-oriented applications, <strong>I prefer JSON to XML due to its simplicity and ease of processing on the client side.</strong> XML may be great on the server side, but JSON is definitely easier to deal with on the client side.</p>

<p>have a look on the following url</p>

<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>

<p>XML is simpler than SGML, but JSON is much simpler than XML. JSON has a much smaller grammar and maps more directly onto the data structures used in modern programming languages.</p>

<p><strong>Extensibility</strong></p>

<p>JSON is not extensible because it does not need to be. JSON is not a document markup language, so it is not necessary to define new tags or attributes to represent data in it.
Interoperability</p>

<p>JSON has the same interoperability potential as XML.</p>

<p><strong>Openness</strong></p>

<p>JSON is at least as open as XML, perhaps more so because it is not in the center of corporate/political standardization struggles.</p>

<p><strong>XML is human readable</strong></p>

<p>JSON is much easier for human to read than XML. It is easier to write, too. It is also easier for machines to read and write.</p>
