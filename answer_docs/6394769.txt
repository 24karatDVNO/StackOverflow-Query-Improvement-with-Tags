<p>Kernel itself would not require the <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> functions, if you do not want to keep the kernel in kernel mode and work the apps you have planned for. But for basic printf and scanf features, you can write your own printf and scanf functions, which would provide basic support for printing ans taking input. I do not have much experience on this, but you can try make a console buffer, where the keyboard driver puts the read in ASCII characters (after conversion from scan codes), and then make the <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> work on it. I have one basic implementation were i have wrote a <code>gets</code> instead of <code>scanf</code> and kept things simple. To get integer output you can write an <code>atoi</code> function to convert the string to a number.</p>

<p>To port in other libraries, you need to make the components which the libraries depend on. You need to make the decision if you can code in those support in the kernel so that the libraries could be ported in. If it is more difficult then coding some basic input output functions i think won't be bad at this stage,</p>
