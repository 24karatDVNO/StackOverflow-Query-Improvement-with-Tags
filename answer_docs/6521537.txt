<p>I couldn't find anything on the public-facing Apple site about it, but I read on one of the rumor sites that Apple will be introducing a new layout system in Lion called Cocoa Autolayout. Unfortunately, it won't be available for the next iOS release.</p>

<p>I don't want to link to any specific documents, but a search for "Cocoa Autolayout" on your favorite search engine will give you some general information how autolayout works.</p>

<p>If you're a registered iOS developer you should have access to one of the WWDC sessions on the topic.</p>
