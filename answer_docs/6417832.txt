<p>You need to pass in your Context in your override, or else declare it static by using something like this:</p>

<pre><code>static public activity = Activity.this;
</code></pre>

<p>This may be bad programming practice, however.  You may want to consider writing a general base class and implementing it as a "controller" for each of your views.</p>

<p>Hope this helped!</p>
