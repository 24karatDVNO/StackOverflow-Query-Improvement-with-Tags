<p>I once did a project at my university to implement arithmetic operations on all kind of numbers (including Integer, Double etc...) or other data structures (such as Intervals or Complex Numbers etc...)</p>

<p>The only way to achieve this is to implement a wrapper class for all the different types:</p>

<pre><code>public interface NumberWrapper&lt;T&gt; {

 public T add(T other);
 public T substract(T other);
 public T sin();
}
</code></pre>

<p>We didn't find a framework to support us in any way.</p>
