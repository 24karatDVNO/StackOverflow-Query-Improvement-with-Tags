<p><strong>1.</strong> You must use some method to stop event from bubbling or captured by parent:</p>

<p>for IE</p>

<pre><code>window.event.cancelBubble = true
</code></pre>

<p>For Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Opera</p>

<pre><code>e.stopPropagation()
e.preventDefault()
</code></pre>

<p><strong>2.</strong> You need to use ajax to submit score from user browser, not from server, because of you will have not user's authentication's token/cookie which use to identify what's user submitting the score. If you use ajax then browser will automatically push cookie together with request then you don't care about that. </p>
