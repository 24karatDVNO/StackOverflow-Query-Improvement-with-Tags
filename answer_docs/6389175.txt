<p>Most modern <code>malloc()</code> implementations allocate in powers of two and have a minimum allocation size, to reduce fragmentation since oddball sizes could generally only be reused when enough contiguous allocations are <code>free()</code>d to make larger blocks.  (It also speeds up coalescing contiguous allocations in general, IIRC.)  Also keep in mind the block overhead; to get the block size you need to add some amount (8 in GNU <code>malloc()</code>, IIRC) for internal management uses.</p>
