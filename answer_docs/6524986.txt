<p>I don't full understand why, but opening (optionally writing content) and closing the document solves the issue (at least in FF5 on OSX):</p>

<pre><code>this.editor.contentWindow.document.open();
// optionally write content here
this.editor.contentWindow.document.close();
this.editor.contentWindow.document.designMode = "on";
</code></pre>

<p>The other idea I had was to set a timeout around the <code>designMode = "on"</code> statement (I remember having to do this in the past for FF), but it did not work.</p>

<p>I think it has something to do with FF loading "something" in the IFRAME and it not being ready to turn designMode on.</p>

<p>I guess you could also use the <code>contentEditable="true"</code> attribute on the DIV instead.</p>

<p>Anyway, I hope this helps.</p>
