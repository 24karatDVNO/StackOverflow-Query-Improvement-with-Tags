<p>I assume this is in regards to your work with Selenium. I had to do a very very similar thing at some point. As far as I'm aware this is not possible without giving the window focus and then simulating real mouse events with SendInput(). When I looked into this I ave up after a few days of investigation and resorted to an extremely hacky solution. Probably you don't want to do this but as a last resort I reverse-engineered part of IE and found the handler which mapped to the event I wanted. I then wrote code which scanned for a certain byte signature that corresponded to this handler. Fortunately it so happened that this particular piece of code didn't change much over the versions of IE I needed to test for. I then injected a DLL into IE which scanned for this signature at runtime to dynamically get the address of the handler. The DLL used IPC to take commands from another executable which would call these handlers appropriately.</p>

<p>I very strongly advise against this method unless you really have no alternative though because of how hacky it is and even though it might work currently there is no guarantee at all it would keep working for future updates of IE. Of course I don't need to tell you this ; )</p>

<p>PS. I don't know if you'll have any luck with <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms681956%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">AttachThreadInput()</a> although I think you'll find you still will have issues with window focus.</p>
