<p>Try using <code>Source</code> binding to a class that will manage the button's visibility state. Adding a property to all your data items would be painfull but could be required if the button's visibility needs to be set based on a property of your data item. As per standard MVVM patterns you can then control the button's visibility from C#. If you need a specific instance of the button you can add a <code>Loaded</code> event handler to it and cache it accordingly.</p>
