<p>3 things i've noticed</p>

<p>*. you are checking the newVal's value twice, it should be something like </p>

<p><code>var newVal = $(this).val();
if (oldVal == newVal).....
</code></p>

<p>*. for the oldValue variable you can just do <code>var oldVal=$('#filed1_id').val();</code> this will be much simpler and will get you the value needed and not the object, this is simpler to handle.</p>

<p>*.  you say you need to check for change on submission but you're checking on change, change it to which means you'll be checking more often when you need to.</p>

<p>and again, it will be nice to know what's getOldValue does.
good luck</p>
