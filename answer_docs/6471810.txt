<pre><code>// Put this before your empty imgs somewhere in your script
function myCb($buffer)
{
    return str_replace('&lt;img src="" /&gt;', '' , $buffer);
}

ob_start('myCb');

// *Your code*...

// Put this after your empty imgs in your script
ob_end_flush();
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that it's probably not the right way to handle this but this answer your question. I suggest not generating empty imgs at all since it would be x times faster.</p>
