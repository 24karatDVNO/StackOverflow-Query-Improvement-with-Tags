<p>Microsoft has said that the official SDK would be out in spring, but spring is coming to an end and we haven't heard anything about it recently, so I guess it's up to you.</p>

<p>If you want to get started, you could look up the Flexible Action and Articulated Skeleton Toolkit (FAAST). It (kind of) has a tutorial on how to get the open source stuff installed. But if you have a 64-bit OS, you need to install the 32-bit versions of the NITE and OpenNI programs. One of them needs to be unstable, the other needs to be stable (I forget which). Anyway, after that you could access the raw depth information from OpenNI, or use the FAAST VRPN stream.</p>

<p>I've only been at this for about a week or two, but I haven't found any good tutorial on this stuff yet. Once you get the programs installed, the information passed (at least from FAAST) is pretty straightforward though. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
