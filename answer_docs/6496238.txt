<p>I suppose I could answer my own question at this point. The Button (controls) being added to the <code>ListView</code> were not being added to the View's collection, but instead simply added directly to the control. This is where I was having difficulty. I'm assuming that only when the collection children for the view grows past a certain point you'll get scrollbars because I simply added a few things to the collection each time I added the a Button and it gave me the bars! Didn't like this solution so obviously simply used a <code>DataGridView</code> for simplicity because of the pre-build <code>ButtonColumn</code>.</p>
