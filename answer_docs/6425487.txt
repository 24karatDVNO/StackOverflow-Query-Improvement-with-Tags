<p>I would suggest running for loops through your documents using something like this:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self, location):
  if os.path.isdir(location): # search directory
    for infile in glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, '*.png')):
    print 'current file is: %s' % infile
</code></pre>

<p>Within the for loop I would suggest using a library such as <a href="http://pybrary.net/pyPdf/" rel="nofollow">pyPDF</a></p>
