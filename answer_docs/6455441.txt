<p>No. You cannot kill the VM with actionscript. There are some AS3 commands to pause/resume (sleep) the flash player VM but these ONLY work in debug mode, which can only be launched locally from the IDE. It may be possible to remove the item using some server side or client side HTML/JS or something but absolutely not from within the VM itself.</p>
