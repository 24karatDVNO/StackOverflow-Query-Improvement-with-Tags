<p>Just call <code>facebook.request("me/friends")</code> from within onComplete and let the rest of the logic follow from that.</p>

<p>That way it will only call once the <code>Facebook</code> onject has an access token and not if there is an error or some such.
You will probably want to use the other callbacks in the <code>DialogListener</code> for a better flow.
Also think about maintaining that facebook object across the application if you plan on making more requests. </p>
