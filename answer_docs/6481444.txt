<p>You're getting a NULL because debug_zval_dump() has a built-in echo feature and you cannot set an echo to a variable.  So your $v = foo() is actually giving you $v = "".  The reason you're getting a refcount of 2 for an empty variable is because of inherent PHP optimization.  </p>

<p>Read about that here: <a href="http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.debug-zval-dump.php" rel="nofollow">http://us3.php.net/manual/en/function.debug-zval-dump.php</a></p>

<p>So to return your value properly you can:</p>

<ol>
<li>Suppress the built-in echo by writing the echo to a buffer</li>
<li>Set the buffer result to a variable</li>
<li>Run your second debug_zval_dump() on that (not NULL) variable</li>
</ol>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>

<pre><code>function myfunc($foo)
{
  debug_zval_dump($foo, 1);
}
ob_start();
/*
starts the output buffer which will catch all code instead of echoing it to page
*/
myfunc('Mouse configuration');

$v = ob_get_contents();
/*
writes the buffer which contains your f(x) results to a var
*/

ob_end_clean();//clears the buffer

debug_zval_dump($v);//will echo non-null value
</code></pre>

<p>The code will result with this:</p>

<p><b>string(65) "string(19) "Mouse configuration" refcount(3) long(1) refcount(1) " refcount(2)</b></p>

<p>I have no idea what this code is meant to do but Good Luck anyways.  :)</p>
