<p>Using exact rational arithmetic for algorithms that require ~670000 arithmetic operations is doomed to failure. How could you ever have thought otherwise? If you need a result accurate to <code>10^-6</code>, then work to an accuracy of (oh, I don't know) <code>10^-20</code>, and use pivoting.</p>
