<p>Perl is definitely more concise than Java, but from a maintenance perspective it's nice to have everything in one language, or at least major modules in one language as opposed to wrapping lots of stuff together. If the rest of the system is java, I'd definitely say rewrite the perl code in java. </p>

<p>Beside the maintenance perspective, you also have to think about documentation. If you are generating docs (say, javadocs) it's nice if you get the full file io functions documented as well. I suppose you could document the wrappers though.</p>
