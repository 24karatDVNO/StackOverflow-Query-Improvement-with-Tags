<p>Have you tried</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body oncontextmenu="return false;"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>for this alongside your current code? Although it could be undone by someone in the browser bar using</p>

<pre><code>javascript:void oncontextmenu(null)
</code></pre>

<p>or by just viewing the source of the page. I would imagine that 99% of users won't go through those hoops though.</p>

<p>It should also disable right click through the entire page which may be undesirable.</p>
