<p>There are many reasons to use classes, not the least of which is encapsulation of logic.  Objects more closely match the world we live in, and are thus often more intuitive than other methodologies.  Consider a car, a car has properties like body color, interior color, engine horsepower, features, current mileage, etc..  It also has methods, like Start (), TurnRight(.30), ApplyBrakes(.50).  It has events like the ding when you open your car door with the keys in the ignition.</p>

<p>Probably the biggest reason is that most applications seem to have a graphical component these days and most of the libraries for graphical user interface are implemented with object models.  </p>

<p>Polymorphism is probably a big reason, too.  The ability to treat multiple types of objects generically is quite helpful.</p>

<p>If you are a mathematician, a functional style may be more intuitive, ML, F#.  If youâ€™re interacting with data in a predictable format, a declarative style would be better like SQL or LINQ.</p>
