<p>Generally I try to avoid setup and teardowns whenever possible. They tend to indicate (teardowns especially) that I am writing integration tests when I should be doing unit tests. 
However, I am known to your situation. When this is needed, I derive the testfixture from a class that handles the licensing. </p>

<pre><code>public class LicencedTestFixture
{
    private LicenseComponent _licenseComponent;

    public LicencedTestFixture()
    {
        _licenseComponent = new LicenseComponent();
        _licenseComponent.Init();
    }

    ~LicencedTestFixture()
    {
        _licenseComponent.Shutdown();
    }

}  
</code></pre>

<p>The test fixture just inherrit from the class, and that is all it needs to know: </p>

<pre><code>[TestFixture]
public sealed class SomeTestFixture: LicencedTestFixture 
{}
</code></pre>
