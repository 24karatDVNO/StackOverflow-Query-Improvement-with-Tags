<p>I'm using Dreamweaver at work, along with ColdFusion and a variety of database flavors to create and update webpages.  I hand-coded basic html for years and I think learning to write static html pages by hand is a valuable experience.  What I like about Dreamweaver is the way it works with Coldfusion to link everything together- the database window is wonderful for being able to check and insert table names directly from one IDE, being able to toggle between code view (just like hand-coding in Notepad ++) and Design view (WYSIWYG graphical interface drag n drop functionality) to preview your changes, etc, is useful to me.</p>

<p>That being said there are a lot of little things to learn if you want to get the most out of Dreamweaver- I ended up paying a one-month subscription to VTC to watch some excellent tutorials.  Definitely worth it in the long run, for me.</p>
