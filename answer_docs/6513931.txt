<p>did you register your search method to run? Could you show your xml?</p>

<p>You should have in your xml something like this: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;button android:layout_width="fill_parent" android:layout_height="wrap_content" android:onClick="search"/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't use the onClick property then your button won't know which method to call when it's tapped.</p>
