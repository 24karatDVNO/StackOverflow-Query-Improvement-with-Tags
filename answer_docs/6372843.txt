<p>This should load the XML into an Object and print it:</p>

<pre><code>{assign var="feeds" value="-RSS FEED LINK-"}
{$feeds|@simplexml_load_string|@print_r}
</code></pre>

<p>But loke Paul said in the comments, I would suggest to do the assignment in PHP and then use smarty to just walk the object.</p>
