<p>Messages, email and sms are ok, but as far as I can find, the Request Dialog is their intended direct replacement.  Sending these out increment the dashboard counters, too.
The caveat with these is that if you want to send them out through the API, you can only send them to people that have accepted your app.  The user must send them out for them to reach out to new users.</p>
