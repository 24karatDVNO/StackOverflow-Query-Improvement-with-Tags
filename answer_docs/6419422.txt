<p>The general approach for sending a RequestFactory payload should be the same as RPC. You can see the payload that's being received by the server by running it with the JVM flag <code>-Dgwt.rpc.dumpPayload=true</code>.  My guess here is that the server is receiving a request with a zero-length payload.  What happens if you set up a simple test involving a  <code>GadgetsRequestBuilder</code> sending a <code>POST</code> request to your server?  Do you still get the same zero-length payload behavior?</p>
