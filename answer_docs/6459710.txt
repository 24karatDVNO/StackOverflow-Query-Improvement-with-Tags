<p>Worked it out.
The return fragment can declare its own ID, naturally, and jQTouch will then treat it as though it were an original part of the document. I had previously assumed jQTouch didn't give a toss about what attributes I gave the fragment; I was wrong.</p>

<p>This means that you could goTo it like any other portion of the document. It also means that you can bind a pageAnimationEnd handler on the return fragment either by ID or by class name and it will behave as expected. Thus:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="formResult"&gt;
&lt;div class="toolbar"&gt;
    &lt;a href="#contact" class="slide back"&gt;Back&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="info"&gt;
    &lt;strong&gt;Thank You For Your Submission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    We have received your inquiry, and blah blah blah jibber jabber.
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p></p>

<p>And:</p>

<pre><code>$('.formReturn').live('pageAnimationEnd', function(evt, info) {
    if (info.direction == 'in') {
        // Goal completion code
    } else {
        $(this).remove();
    }
});
</code></pre>
