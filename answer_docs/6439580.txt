<p>Recently, I tried to install GCC-4.6. I have documented my findings <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6372600/problem-with-gcc-4-6-installation-on-ubuntu">in answer to this question</a>. You can download the <code>tar</code> for gcc3.x from the website and follow the same procedure.</p>
