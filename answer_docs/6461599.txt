<p>This started happening with me, but only after I included the delayed_job gem in my bundle. Like Eric above, I included ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper and ActionView::Helpers::NumberHelper at the top of a controller, but the funny thing is that I had no problems whatsoever until I started using delayed_job. I've no idea what's going on, I just removed the includes and the problem seems to have disappeared.</p>
