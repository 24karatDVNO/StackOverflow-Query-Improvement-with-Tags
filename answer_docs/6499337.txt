<p>Take a look at some of the classes in .Net's <code>System.Collections.Generic</code> namespace - many of them support 7+ interfaces. It's not something to be worried about (from a design point of view). A class should implement any and all interfaces which it was intended to implement. </p>

<p>So there's not a numeric limit to the number of interfaces a class should implement. The only question is whether those interfaces make sense for the class.</p>
