<p>I was thinking the exact same thing today.</p>

<p>While the functionality is not in vanilla VS, it is quite possible to modify some code to add this functionality. For example, the XAML Presenter, probably named after the presenter component that you have to modify does something similiar.<a href="http://karlshifflett.wordpress.com/2010/03/21/visual-studio-2010-xaml-editor-intellisense-presenter-extension/http://" rel="nofollow">XAML Presenter</a></p>

<p>It narrows by namespace and sorts by attribute type. Basically, I'm just gonna take the list the Intellisense Completion Source gives and sort the list.  Sounds simple enough.</p>

<p>More challenging is implementing the UI controls. I hate designing UI controls . . .</p>

<p>Edit: </p>

<p>However, I don't forsee a way to do this without breaking Resharper's Intelllisense features.</p>
