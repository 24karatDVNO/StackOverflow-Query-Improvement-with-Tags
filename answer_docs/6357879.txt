<p>If you check the phpmyadmin changelog (<a href="http://demo.phpmyadmin.net/master-config/changelog.php" rel="nofollow">http://demo.phpmyadmin.net/master-config/changelog.php</a>), it does appear there are a few issues noted regarding this problem with earlier versions of PMA (see the note under 3.4.0.0 about defaulting to UNHEX). You might want to upgrade to the latest version and see if these problems still exist.</p>
