<p>I think that now Google Apps has a built-in feature for forwarding of naked domains. You just go to "Domain Settings" tab in Google Apps management panel. There you click "Domain Names" sub-tab. Enter the destination where to forward your naked domain. Then you make changes to DNS, adding A record for your domain to Google provided IP. That's it.</p>
