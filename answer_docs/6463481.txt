<p>What you need is a rich text component that is based on canvas rather than contentEditable. Unfortunately such a thing doesn't yet exist as far as I am aware, at least not as a ready to use component. </p>

<p>You can use jQuery to update the content in any of SharePoint's editable areas and it will be saved (I know this mostly because it tends to save dynamic stuff I don't want saved), so it is possible to set something up with a textarea and sync script, but probably more work than you are looking for.</p>
