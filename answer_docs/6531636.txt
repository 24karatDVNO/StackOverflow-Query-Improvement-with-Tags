<p>The QtSDK installation usually install the mingw compiler for you in ...\QtSDK\mingw. The libraries and dlls in ...\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.7.3\mingw were compiled with this compiler. The mingw compiler you installed to c:\MinGW may be a different version than that. If you want to use this compiler you would have to recompile the Qt libraries.</p>
