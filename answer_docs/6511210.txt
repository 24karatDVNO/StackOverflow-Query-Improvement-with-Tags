<p>to close this one up, the function should look like this ($i was in the wrong loop):</p>

<pre><code>public function getArtistTracks(){
    if( $tracks = getTracks() ){
        $i = 0;
        foreach ( $tracks['results'] as $track ){
            // $artistName is an array of strings (defined as public)
            $name[$this-&gt;artistName][$i] = $track['name'];
            $i++;               
        }
    }

    return $name;
}
</code></pre>
