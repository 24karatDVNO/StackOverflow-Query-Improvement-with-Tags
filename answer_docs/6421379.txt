<blockquote>
  <p>for = idref [CS] This attribute
  explicitly associates the label being
  defined with another control. When
  present, the value of this attribute
  must be the same as the value of the
  id attribute of some other control in
  the same document. When absent, the
  label being defined is associated with
  the element's contents.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you currently have the <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> inside of the <code>&lt;label&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>If you move the content outside without setting the <code>for</code> attribute, it should do what your're after:</p>

<p><code>&lt;label&gt;Date&lt;label&gt;&lt;select&gt;&lt;/select&gt;...</code></p>
