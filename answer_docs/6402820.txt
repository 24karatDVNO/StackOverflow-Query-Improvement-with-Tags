<p>The <code>onConfigurationChanged</code> is in the View only "Since: API Level 8". If you are developing against an earlier version, there is no such method, so you can't override and call them. There is one in "activity", and you can prove your code to be correct by changing your extends into activity. This will not work for compiling ofcourse since you want an adapter, but as a proof of concept for your imports and all it will :)</p>
