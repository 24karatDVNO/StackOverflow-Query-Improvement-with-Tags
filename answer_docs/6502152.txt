<p>Not too sure with oracle - been a long time since i used it.  But from memory it wasn't to dissimilar from mssql.</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE newTable 
SET DUPLICATE = 'Y'
WHERE Country IN (
   SELECT COUNT(Country)
   FROM newTable
   GROUP BY Country
   HAVING Count(Country) &gt; 1
)


UPDATE newTable 
SET DUPLICATE = 'N'
WHERE Country IN (
   SELECT COUNT(Country)
   FROM newTable
   GROUP BY Country
   HAVING Count(Country) = 1
)
</code></pre>
