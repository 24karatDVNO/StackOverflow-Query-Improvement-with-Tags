<p>Not sure exactly what your DB looks like but I'll assume it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>stories:
  id
  content

tags:
  id
  name

story_tags:
  story_id
  tag_id
</code></pre>

<p>Try running a query first just to see if it gives you the intended results:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT stories.id, COUNT(*) AS ordering FROM stories 
  INNER JOIN story_tags ON story_tags.story_id = stories.id 
  WHERE story_tags.tag_id IN ('id of tag a', 'id of tag b', 'id of tag c', 'id of tag d') 
  GROUP BY stories.id
  ORDER BY ordering DESC;
</code></pre>
