<p>I think its safe to say that WPF, in such a project as you describe can be 33% faster, basically because the results are more predictable and controllable.  In the end, everyone wants it to look like they want it to look.</p>

<p>WPF is much more naturally reusable and scalable than any ASP.NET project could be.  Everything you build can be easily turned into a user control with binding built in.  I prefer MVVM to MVC.</p>

<p>I would say you can get something (like a database view) working faster in ASP.NET, but to get it to look like you want will be a lot harder.  So your development time really is dependent on how flexible your UI requirements are.  If you want to make a new control, it will take a lot longer in ASP.NET and be harder to describe how to use that control to others.</p>

<p>I also started programming recently with VB6 for desktop apps and JQuery with PHP.  Development goes a lot faster with these languages than with anything .NET related, because .NET must be compiled.  This is a major major drawback to this language.  Often it can take quite some time to compile a complicated website.  For this reason, for my own personal use, I will stick with jQuery, PHP web services and MySQL.</p>
