<p>I did the same yesterday and it worked perfectly for me. What I made was copy/paste the theme to a new file in my project named "AccordionTheme.xaml" and I inserted it into my Control like this :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;UserControl.Resources&gt;
    &lt;ResourceDictionary Source="Themes\AccordionTheme.xaml" /&gt;
&lt;/UserControl.Resources&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe you have either done something wrong by copy/paste or maybe an error with inserting it into your control/window ?</p>
