<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6442013/jquery-grid-for-asp-net-c">And this</a><br>
<a href="http://blueorbitsoftware.com/blog/?p=17" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here's another one</a>  </p>

<p>The first one is very detail in which jquery grids plugins are out there. From there you can google like crazy and find a couple of interesting asp.net implementations. Not very clear (i'm in that process too) but they can help you a little bit.<br>
The other too are more focus to your question.<br>
Hope we find what we are looking for.</p>
