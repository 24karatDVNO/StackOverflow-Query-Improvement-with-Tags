<p>Solved the problem by using a foreign key on the log_activity table like this:</p>

<pre><code>FOREIGN KEY(log_id) REFERENCES log(_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
</code></pre>

<p>and a delete statement like this:</p>

<pre><code>long userId = 1;
int keepXLogsOfOthers = 1;
String del = "DELETE FROM log" +
                " WHERE user_id != " + userId +
                "  AND log._id NOT IN (" +
                "    SELECT _id" +
                "    FROM (" +
                "      SELECT _id" +
                "      FROM log" +
                "      WHERE user_id != " + userId +
                "      ORDER BY timestamp DESC" +
                "      LIMIT " + keepXLogsOfOthers +
                "    ) logs_of_others_to_keep" +
                ");";
db.execSql(del);
</code></pre>

<p>Don't forget to enable foreign keys:</p>

<pre><code>db.execSQL("PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;");
</code></pre>

<p>and I had the issue that the emulator did not cascade the log_activities.. but on a device it works. Thanks to the other answerers who gave me some hints.</p>

<p>See my question again for more details.</p>
