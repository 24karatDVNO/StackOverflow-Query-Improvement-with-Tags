<p>devise module Database Authenticatable. as github says its responsible for</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Database Authenticatable: encrypts and
  stores a password in the database to
  validate the authenticity of a user
  while signing in. The authentication
  can be done both through POST requests
  or HTTP Basic Authentication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe you want to not include this module in you User model.
Also im guess if you dont want to store password, than creating your own registration/authentication process is a great idea. See Ryan <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/21-super-simple-authentication" rel="nofollow">screencast</a> about it, should be enough, just cut the part with password.</p>
