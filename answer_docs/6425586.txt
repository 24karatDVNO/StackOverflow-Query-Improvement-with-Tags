<p>My suggestion would be to hit the books. You admit you really don't understand AJAX or JQuery. You're in no position to ask users here to get your code working. SO users expect posters to put in a minimum of effort before they help. They get annoyed and downvote questions that expect them to do all the work. </p>

<p>Check out general articles for ASP.Net developers such as the following:</p>

<p>When you have done the research you will be in a position to ask tightly scoped questions that someone will be willing to answer. And more importantly, you will be in a position to actually evaluate what they are telling you.</p>
