<p>I have found that with some changes (such as column sizes in a <code>ListView</code>) the changes are not always applied.  What seemed to work for me was closing the design view and opening is up again.  Probably also had something to do with the fact that my <code>view</code> (interface) was a <code>UserControl</code> that required rebuilding. </p>
