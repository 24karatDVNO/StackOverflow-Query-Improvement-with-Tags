<p>No, for security reasons the Flash Player Settings panels are not accessible to developers, therefore you cannot modify or remove any of them. </p>

<p>Things you cannot control in Flash Player Settings panel:</p>

<ul>
<li>The UI from any component within the settings panels</li>
<li>There are no Events being dispatched (neither by components or by the panel itself)</li>
<li>You cannot force a panel to close</li>
<li>There's no way to know if a panel is open or closed (note that the user can use the flash menu to open the settings panel)</li>
</ul>

<p>The only thing you can control is which panel should be open, after that it's all up to the user.</p>

<p>To open a Security Panel (i.e. the Camera panel):</p>

<pre><code>Security.showSettings(SecurityPanel.CAMERA);
</code></pre>
