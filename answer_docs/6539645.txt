<p>@Prashant's response gave me the inspiration for this, and it's very similar, but I believe will solve your problem.</p>

<p>If the other process must match a certain filename pattern</p>

<ul>
<li>Rename the file to something that
won't match first, a very cheap/fast
operation</li>
<li>Rename it back when finished</li>
</ul>

<p>If it matches every file in a given folder</p>

<ul>
<li>Move it to another folder (also a very cheap operation in most filesystems)</li>
<li>Move it back when finished.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the other process had already locked your file (even for read) then your process would fail, and you can make that graceful. If not you should be safe.</p>

<p>There is still a race condition possibility, of course, but this should be much safer than what you are doing.</p>
