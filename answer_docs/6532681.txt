<p>Many transformations are best split into a pipeline where each stage of the pipeline performs one simple task.</p>

<p>You can do a multi-stage transformation within a single stylesheet (by holding the results in variables, especially with XSLT 2.0), or you can do it using multiple stylesheets. You can control a pipeline involving multiple stylesheets with a variety of technologies (XProc, Coccoon, Orbeon, Ant, xmlsh) or from your own Java/C# code. Using multiple stylesheets has the advantage that the components of the pipeline are highly reusable.</p>
