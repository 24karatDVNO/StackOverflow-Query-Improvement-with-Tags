<p>You will have to send the list to the page outside of jqgrid.  jqgrid will only pull a page at a time and does not know about all your other data if you are using it in ajax mode.  </p>

<p>If this is just a matter of using the mydata that you have above and the data is all in the scope of js, but just on another page (result set on jqgrid) why dont you build the list and use that in place of the var called texts.  You are only going over the page data, not all the data you load in.  Does this make sense?</p>
