<p>Our <a href="http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/Clone" rel="nofollow">CloneDR</a> static analysis tool will find exact and near-duplicate copies of arbitrary code fragments for many languages, including JavaScript.   It will do so within and across files.   (CloneDR does not detect unused code.)</p>
