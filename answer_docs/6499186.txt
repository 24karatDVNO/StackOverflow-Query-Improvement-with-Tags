<p>When I'm in development mode I use <a href="http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/01/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-in-firefox-4/" rel="nofollow">ECMAScript 5 strict mode</a> for javascript.</p>

<p>I've never found anything for CSS and HTML. I usually just run pages through validation pages, but I'd like to know if you find anything that achieves this, keep us posted!</p>
