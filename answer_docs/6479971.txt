<p>In the following case, it is not necessary, because the generic type is declared/defined as part of the class definition:</p>

<pre><code>public class Example&lt;T&gt; {

    public T generateItem() { return null; };

<p>In the following case, it is necessary, because the generic type is <strong>NOT</strong> declared/defined as part of the class definition (or elsewhere):</p>

<pre><code>public class Example {

    public &lt;T&gt; T generateItem() { return null; };

}
</code></pre>

<p>The rule is: is it declared somewhere in the context or not? That's it!</p>
