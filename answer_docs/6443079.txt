<p>You might find useful resources on the <a href="http://www.generic-programming.org/languages/conceptcpp/" rel="nofollow">ConceptsGCC website</a>. That's the compiler (forked off GCC) which they were building to see if the concept (pardon the pun) was feasible.</p>

<p>I imagine the expense comes from having to perform thorough and ubiquitous and recursive validity checks on all sorts of language constructs, and given that you could specify a pretty rich set of constraints, checking for those can get very expensive.</p>

<p>A bit like a nightmare version of exception specifications!</p>
