<p>If you don't find a solutions, I would recommend you use <a href="http://jqueryfordesigners.com/jquery-infinite-carousel/" rel="nofollow">http://jqueryfordesigners.com/jquery-infinite-carousel/</a>. I was looking for a Carousel recently, and found this the easiest and most easy to play around with. </p>

<p>This also prevented a jQuery Version Conflict which other Carousels were giving me.</p>
