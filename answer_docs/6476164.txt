<p>Not sure if this is exactly what you're trying to do but check this demo out.</p>

<p>Basically what I'm doing is applying the <b>dim</b> class to everything that is not in focus (excluding the label tags in this example). This allows only the focused field to be at full opacity.</p>

<p><em>EDIT: Changed my code a little to include a <code>keyup</code> event which allows this to work with tabbing.</em></p>

<pre><code>$('.sectionBox').bind('click keyup', function() {
    $(this).removeClass('dim')
    .children().removeClass('dim')
    .not(':focus, label').addClass('dim');
});
</code></pre>
