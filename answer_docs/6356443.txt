<p>If you use UTF-8 as source and then output it in html remember to set the correct headers and meta like this:</p>

<pre><code> &lt;?php
 header ('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8');
 ?&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;
 &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"&gt;
 &lt;/head&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise you have problems in displaying. </p>

<p>No need to decode/encode anything as Pekka suggested you should not encode them in the first place but use a CData block. T
hen if you set your header and meta correctly you just output them. Saves you a lot of work.</p>

<p>In case your source is encode, just output it to the browser as is</p>
