<p>How about this?  (If I understood your question)</p>

<p>(I haven't actually run it - just a thought - so... could be errors, or I could have blatantly missed something.  But - for the moment, my tired head thinks it would work :)</p>

<pre><code>$num_topics = 5;
$stories_per = 5;
$stories = array();  //array to store story ids

//select 5 topics
$query = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM topics ORDER BY RAND() LIMIT ".$num_topics);

//run repeat as many times as you want stories
for($i=0; $i&lt;$stories_per; $i++) {

    //repeat through each selected topic
    while($row = mysql_fetch_array($query)) {

        $q_addon = "";
        foreach($stories as $value) {
            $q_addon .= "id &lt;&gt; '".$value."' AND ";
        }

        //find a story not yet chosen for each topic
        $q = mysql_query("SELECT storyid FROM stories_topics WHERE ".$q_addon." topicid='".$row['id']."' LIMIT 1");

        //add that id to your $stories array
        $tmp_id = mysql_result($q,0,'storyid');
        array_push($stories, $tmp_id);

    }
}
