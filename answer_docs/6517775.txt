<p>Ok. I did it.
It wasn't so hard to add taxonomy tags to nodes and make them specified by nodes author. Then I used <a href="http://drupal.org/project/relevant_content" rel="nofollow">Relevant Content module</a> which creates a block with nodes relevant content in it by the nodes taxonomy criteria. And it works like a charm!</p>
