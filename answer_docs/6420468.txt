<p>@KilZone: Thanks for the reply. I haven't tried your code, but the string that was being fetched from the database was showing properly in the brower, but when i checked it by viewing the source, the string was having <code>&amp;quot;</code> instead of double quote.</p>

<p>So I just used the below code to replace, and it solved my problem.</p>

<pre><code>json_decode(str_replace("&amp;quot;","\"",$item-&gt;extra_fields))
</code></pre>

<p>Thank you everyone for the reply.</p>
