<p>Is this a WinForms application?</p>

<p>If so, in the Visual Studio designer, after you drag a contextMenuStrip from the boolbox, it allows you to type new entries at the contextMenuStrip (click where it says 'Type Here' to add a new item).  If you are going back to an existing contextMenuStrip, you will have to make it appear by clicking on the contextMenuStrip item at the bottom of the designer.</p>

<p>Once you have the item, you can just double-click on it to whatever code you want to execute on the click event.  (This is the default event; for other events you will have to double-click the appropriate event from the Properties pane.</p>
