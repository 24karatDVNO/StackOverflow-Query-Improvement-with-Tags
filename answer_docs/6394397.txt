<p>Tangentially related - one of the most interesting projects I have done so far involved writing my own database scripting utility, initially aimed at generating basic CRUD sprocs for each table in a (MS Access or MS SQL Server 2005) database, and then creating very basic class files represeting each class. </p>

<p>Of course, visual studio will also do this for you in a number of different ways out of the box. However, most of that implementation is tightly coupled with ADO.NET, LINQ, and EF. </p>

<p>If you don;t find one that does what you need, take a stab at it. </p>

<p>What I came up with was semi-crude and brute force, but the process was quite educational. </p>

<p>I have since been expanding it to generate a CREATE script for MS Access Databases (which Access does not provide out of the box). </p>
