<p>What you want is the <code>Chain of Reponsibilty</code> Pattern. Have instances of each subtype of <code>Product</code> in a <code>Set</code> and just walk the <code>Set</code> and call <code>.create(final Product p);</code> on each one, they will decided if the type is the correct one, and do what they need to do. This eleminates the nasty <code>if/elseif</code> construct and scales out to lots and lots of subclasses.</p>
