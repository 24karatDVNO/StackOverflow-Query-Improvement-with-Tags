<p>There was <a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/waiting_for_jwebpane" rel="nofollow">JWebPane</a>, a Java component based on WebKit, but that project seems to have died a long time ago and/or has just gone quiet. Some people are still hoping it will be released, The other one I know of is <a href="http://www.genuitec.com/about/labs-webkit-for-swt/WebKit%20For%20SWT%20Developer%20Guide.html" rel="nofollow">WebKit for SWT</a>, but it appears to be for Win32 only. :(</p>
