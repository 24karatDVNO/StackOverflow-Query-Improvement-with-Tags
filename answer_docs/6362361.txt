<p>There are many paths in a 3x3 grid. </p>

<ul>
<li>Most paths end at the corners (that
only requires 3 cells to have been
visited). </li>
<li>Then some end at the edges
(those require 5 cells to have been
visited).</li>
<li>There are very few
paths that end at the center (they
require all 8 surrounding cells to
have been visited).</li>
</ul>

<p>Two paths that are common up to a cell only increment your 'visited' counter for those cells once. For example, paths A-B-C-D and A-B-C-E increment A, B, and C only once. Your code does not really count visits in distinct paths - to do that, you would need to substitute</p>

<pre><code>void visit(int x, int y, int level) {
   ...
   visited[x][y] += 1;
   ...
      visit(x + i, y + j, level + 1);
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>with </p>

<pre><code>int visit(int x, int y, int level) {
   ...
   int child_paths = 1; // do not increment visited[x][y] yet
   ...
      child_paths += visit(x + i, y + j, level + 1);
   ...
   visited[x][y] += child_paths;
   return child_paths;
}
</code></pre>
