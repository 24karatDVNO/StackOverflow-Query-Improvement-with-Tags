<p>Personally I prefer the IntelliJ. I was a big fan of Eclipse but when I started using IntelliJ (with some learning curve), I just love it ! The community edition now offers support for Android SDK. However, unfortunately there is no support for building UIs ! So, my solution for now is to configure IntelliJ projects with Android libraries, use Eclipse as a UI builder tool and then use those XML files in INtellJ. I know its a painful process but that is how I get the best of both worlds !</p>
