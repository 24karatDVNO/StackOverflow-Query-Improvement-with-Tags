<p>Did you try this in a compiler?  There's one availble for free on the web...</p>

<pre><code>#include "stdio.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv)
{
  int a = 6;
  int b = 7;
  int c;
  c = a + b;
  printf("%i\n", c);
  return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, there is no 4-bit int in C.  If you have a 4-bit int, you're not using a standard-compliant version of C.</p>

<p>See this question - <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/271076/what-is-the-difference-between-an-int-and-a-long-in-c/271132#271132">What is the difference between an int and a long in C++?</a></p>
