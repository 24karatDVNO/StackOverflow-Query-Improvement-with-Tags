<p>You want to check stuName[i][20], stuName[i][21] to see if the last character is null. However, even when you write the first name, the last character is still null. You will need to keep some kind of counter to check what name you are up to.</p>

<p>Also, the if in the set function should have squiggly braces to include the break, otherwise it will always break when i=0.</p>
