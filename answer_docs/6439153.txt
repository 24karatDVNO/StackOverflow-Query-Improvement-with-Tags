<p>There is a <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/solutions/4/qtbrowserplugin/index.html" rel="nofollow">netscape plugin</a> that will host a QT application and an <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/activeqt.html" rel="nofollow">ActiveX control wrapper</a> on the QT website.  You could use one of those to wrap your application.  Note that this approach would require the user (or their administrator) to download and install the plugin.</p>

<p>An alternative approach might be to run your application through a remote desktop such as XVNC, NX or an RDP based layer.  IIRC browser based remote desktop clients are available for most such protocols.</p>
