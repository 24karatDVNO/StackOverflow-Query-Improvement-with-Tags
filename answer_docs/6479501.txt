<p>As everyone has said you don't need to set it to null. I just want to add that I had a similar question before which might not be obvious. If you have a doubly linked list, where each node references the previous and the next node, for example A-B-C-D and you remove C-D so that you're left with A-B. You also do not need to worry about C or D even though both of them still have a reference to them (from the other one). Apparently the GC is smart enough to take care of that case as well</p>
