<p>This has been discussed before plenty. The phrase I believe you're looking for is "Dynamically adding button". It's very simple once you learn the basics of it all, and you should be able to set any of the attributes of the button dynamically (in your program) whether it be size, position, or even the onClickListener(). Look <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/view/ScrollView2.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> for a basic example. Hope it helps.</p>
