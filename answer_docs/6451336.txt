<p>In such case you should use standard ADO.NET. <code>ExecuteStoreQuery</code> expects type (either entity, complex type or custom type) as generic parameter. The instance of this type will be used for mapping result's columns to properties of the type. If you don't know the type upfront you cannot use the method.</p>
