<p>I already use hierarchical data structure and i use this query to fetch same floor category</p>

<pre><code>SELECT node.* ,count( parent.id ) -1 AS depth FROM pages node 
JOIN pages parent ON node.lft BETWEEN parent.lft AND parent.rgt 
WHERE ...[ Your clause Statment ]... GROUP BY node.id HAVING depth = 0
</code></pre>
