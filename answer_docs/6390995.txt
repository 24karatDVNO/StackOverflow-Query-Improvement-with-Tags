<p>You should probably do this,</p>

<pre><code>- (void)imagePickerController:(UIImagePickerController *)picker didFinishPickingMediaWithInfo:(NSDictionary *)info
{
    // Process the photo taken

    // unlink this view controller as the delegate
    picker.delegate = nil; 

    // Create the 2nd controller and show - this doesn't work and the child controller is not visible for some reason
    ChildController *child = [[ChildController alloc] initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:child animated:NO];
    [child release];

    // Dismiss the UIImagePickerController 
    [self dismissModalViewControllerAnimated:YES];                          
}   
</code></pre>

<p>This way you add <code>child</code> to the navigation hierarchy and dismiss the image picker. A single animation will show the image picker being dismissed to reveal <code>child</code> controller.</p>
