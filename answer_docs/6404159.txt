<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;
    &lt;span style="header-color1"&gt;Why use &lt;/span&gt; 
    &lt;span style="header-color1"&gt;mysite.com?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And then style the <code>header-color1</code> and <code>header-color2</code> spans accordingly. This will look weird though, having a header in 2 different colors... not very good design imo but maybe your designer has a good idea, not sure.</p>

<p>This would not be overly difficult in jQuery but I think it would be a case of <code>overuse</code>.</p>
