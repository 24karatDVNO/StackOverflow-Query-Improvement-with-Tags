<p>Without seeing all the code it's hard to tell, but you can try adding after</p>

<pre><code>        [todayListArray writeToFile:[self todayListPath] atomically:YES];
        [self.tableView reloadData];
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you don't have to retain that button, and probably don't have to have it as a property</p>
