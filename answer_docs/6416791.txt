<p>Hmmm... I see answers "It's impossible", so just to show that it is possible and it will work almost fast as DB, I'll put this php-class:<br>
<a href="http://www.filefactory.com/file/cee5cb6/n/sypexgeo.zip" rel="nofollow">http://www.filefactory.com/file/cee5cb6/n/sypexgeo.zip</a></p>

<p>It's not my code, you'll see authors in comments.
This library is not supported anymore by authors and some IP can't be defined.
If you will put content of file SypexGeo.dat into cache (322Kb), it will work faster, than DB, but in case with DB you can easily update list of new IP's.</p>
