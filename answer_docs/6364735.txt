<p>From what I understand you should never modify anything but cell content within a cell in cellForRowAtIndexPath. Check out one of my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4937319/changing-an-object-in-uitableviewcell-is-also-changing-the-object-of-a-reused-uit">questions</a> from a while back.

  <p>So the golden rule is: NEVER change
  the cell structure after you've dequed

  structure then use DIFFERENT cell IDs.
  Of course the more customizable is the
  cell the easier is the possibility to
  reuse them.</p>
