<p>If you try to implement a counter inside your class that counts how many instances have been created, you will see immediately why class variables can do the work, while instance variables can not. </p>

<pre><code>public class MyClass {
   private static int count;

   public MyClass() {
      count++;
      ...
   }

   public static int getCount() {
      return count;
   }
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can call <code>MyClass.getCount();</code> even before having created a single MyClass instance.</p>
