<p>If you're really serious about learning C++ I would recommend C++ Primer Plus by Stephen Prata (<a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0672326973" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>) It is by far the best introduction to standard C++ I've seen but note that it will only go over STANDARD C++. No graphics or game programming.</p>
