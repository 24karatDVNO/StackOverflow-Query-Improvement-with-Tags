<p>I got that the problem was with the Page_UnLoad event: it was invoked each time the next/previous page button in Cristal Report was clicked, disposing the Viewer and causing the Object Reference exception.</p>

<p>I added a condition to check if a PostBack happens:</p>

<pre><code>    protected void Page_UnLoad (object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (!IsPostBack)
        {
            if (_crystalReportViewer != null)
                _crystalReportViewer.Dispose();
            _crystalReportViewer = null;

            if (_myReportDocument != null)
            {
                _myReportDocument.Close();
                _myReportDocument.Dispose();
            }
            _myReportDocument = null;

            GC.Collect();
        }           
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately a small problem still persist: on the TEST machine, everything works fine but once deployed on DEV machine (they are 2 different servers with apparently same settings), it is possible to view just the first 2 records of the report, then by clicking on "Next" button of the CR Viewer nothing happens. All other features like "Go TO" and "Print" from CR work fine.
It is quite strange since the database settings are correct, the report and code are the same...any idea?</p>
