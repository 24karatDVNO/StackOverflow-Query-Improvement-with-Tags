<p>I believe that an existential type is returned to make it clear that the cast that you may want to make is your responsibility. <code>Class</code> is a bit weird: for instance, a <code>Class[List[String]]</code> should actually be typed as a <code>Class[List[_]]</code> as it does not carry any information about the <code>String</code> parametrization of <code>List</code>. The cast suggested by Kim is always safe when <code>T</code> is not itself a parametrized type.</p>
