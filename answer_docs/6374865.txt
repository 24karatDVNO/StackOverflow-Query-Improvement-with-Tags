<p>This turned out to be an issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" rel="nofollow">DNS</a> lookups (deployment provider <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Locator" rel="nofollow">URL</a> was a hostname that didn't look up for me), because I wasn't on the same domain as the deploy application. I wish I knew a workaround, but for now I'll deal.</p>
