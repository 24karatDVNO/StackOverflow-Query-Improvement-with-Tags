<p>Seems okay to me. What about using a LinkedList instead? When using a List, if you remove the first item, all of the other items have to be bumped back one item. With a LinkedList, you can add or remove items anywhere in the list at very little cost. However, I don't know how much difference this would make, since we're only talking about ten items.</p>

<p>The trade-off of a linked list is that you can't efficiently access random elements of the list, because the linked list must essentially "walk" along the list, passing each item, until it gets to the one you need. But for sequential access, linked lists are fine.</p>
