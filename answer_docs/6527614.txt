<p>Why don't you play 2 midi files at the same time, while only using one to actually output the audio (if the audio API supports it...)</p>

<p>Or even better, parse the entire midi file once.
Get the note and it's timing, and store it in one big array.
When playing the actual midi file, use the array you just filled to visualize the notes.</p>
