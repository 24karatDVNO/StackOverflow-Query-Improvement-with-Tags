<p>I had an Internet Radio startup a few years back... The economy/lack of funding/lack of interest funded it.  We had a couple of demo stations running through ice cast and it worked very well for us. We used a front end solution we wrote in Flash/Actionscript for scheduling the music and breaks.</p>

<p>I think you're skill set is probably adequate to create the front end that you describe.  I will tell you that you will likely find the Sound model in as accessed through JS/jQuery limiting and may want to consider Flash at this point... Even HTML5's audio tag cannot access meta data in the music file, or give you the ability to have users adjust the pan.  </p>

<p>Flash has a very rich set of sound classes that you may benefit from.</p>

<p>Sounds like a fun project! Good luck! </p>
