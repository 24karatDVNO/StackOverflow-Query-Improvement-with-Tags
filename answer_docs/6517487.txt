<p>as far as my knowledge is concerned we cannot commit the code to a repository unless it is checked out from the same repository.</p>

<p>one way to commit in your case is upload the downloaded code from client repository to your repository,check out the same and make changes and then commit. i know this is not as desired by you.</p>

<p>if you find a better approach plz update so that it helps others too..</p>
