<p>Your code example is working for me too..</p>

<p>however at a guess I'd say there is an absolutely positioned div (not in the code above) "over the top" of your buttons</p>

<p>try adding <code>position: relative;</code> to <code>&lt;div id="buttonpanel"&gt;</code> it may work on it's own if not try adding a <code>z-index</code> too</p>
