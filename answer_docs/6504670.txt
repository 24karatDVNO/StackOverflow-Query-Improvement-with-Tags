<p>It seems your carrier might be blocking access to RTSP. Youtube works because it is a popular service and it is bound to be allowed in your carrier's proxy.</p>

<p>I have developed applications that can access RTSP server over Wifi or 3G without problems on Android. Nonetheless we know our carrier sets no restrictions and our phone are unlocked.</p>

<p>Is your phone locked to a particular carrier? Is your APN configured to use a proxy? You could use alternative SIM/APN settings to override this.</p>
