<p>I think that this will be fast enough:</p>

<pre><code>function daysAgo(dt) {
    var diff = Math.floor((new Date() - dt) / 86400000);
    if (diff === 1)       
    {
        return diff + ' day ago';
    } else {
        return diff + ' days ago';
    }
}

function minsAgo(dt) {
    var diff = Math.floor((new Date() - dt) / 60000);
    if (diff === 1)       
    {
        return diff + ' minute ago';
    } else {
        return diff + ' minutes ago';
    }
}

var then = new Date('2011-06-23T13:20:12+0000');
document.write(then + '&lt;br /&gt;');
document.write(daysAgo(then) + '&lt;br /&gt;');
document.write(minsAgo(then));
</code></pre>

<p>You can write the other functions for weeks and hours similarly. Also, these are approximations because of the <code>Math.floor</code> call, but I figured that would be good enough.</p>
