<p>If the library is linked dynamically, you can run <code>ldd</code> on whatever executable you are running to determine which is being selected. If it isn't what you expect, you can set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to override the search path for shared objects. And if it's linked statically, the path must be somewhere in the makefile. Use grep to find it.</p>
