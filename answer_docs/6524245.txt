<p>I'd guess the best way would be to collect a DateTime value from your user's PC whenever they submit text.</p>

<p>From that, you should be able to determine what time zone they are in based on the number of hours difference.</p>

<p>Then, whenever you display the time stamp in your application, add or subtract the number of hours difference.</p>
