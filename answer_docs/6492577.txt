<p>What I'd probably do is have an enum type on the Model to switch against.</p>

<pre><code>if(panelCount &lt; NumberOfPanelsToShow)
{
  switch(model.modelType)
  {
   case Model.Car:
    // do stuff
  break;
  }
  panelCount++;
}
</code></pre>

<p>We'll need more information though really to determine how to handle the cases and how many conditions can apply at any given time.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>Given the additional information you've provided, some of the other answers here seem more appropriate. This answer won't be sufficient given your current case.</p>
