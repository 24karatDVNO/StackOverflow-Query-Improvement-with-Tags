<p>Without seeing your code, my guess is that PHP's garbage collection (freeing up of unused memory) isn't run in the time it takes your script to run.</p>

<p>Point of story, this behavior is acceptable and expected. So long as you aren't getting any out of memory errors, you should be alright.</p>
