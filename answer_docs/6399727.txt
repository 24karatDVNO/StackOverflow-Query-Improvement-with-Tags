<p>Really, if you want to make animations by hand, rather than programmatically, Flash is the answer. Give them both a whirl. They work well together. You can program in Flash, but it's a little weak in that area. Things might have improved since I last used it. Flash's strength is in actually creating graphics and animations. </p>

<p>Flash Builder on the other hand is an Eclipse based environment, and is specifically for programming/debugging/profiling/ui layout - like VS, Eclipse or Netbeans: Not really what I would call an animation tool. But you can certainly make things move/rotate etc, and load or embed animations in SWF format.</p>

<p>The docs explain how to embed external assets in Flex here - including swfs: <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=embed_4.html" rel="nofollow">Embedding Asset Types</a></p>
