<p>You could also use the function <code>mysql_num_rows</code>, which will tell you the number of rows returned by your query.</p>

<pre><code>$rows = mysql_num_rows($searchResult);
if($rows &lt;= 0){
    /* Code if there are no rows */
}
else{
    /* At least one row has been found */
}
</code></pre>
