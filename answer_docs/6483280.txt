<p>I would assume that the synergies between two different plugins like those two are very few. If you really like the way your theme looks though, you can always grab its markup code a reconstruct the theme with Shopp template tags &amp; functions.</p>

<p>Approaching this is a lot like making a new theme entirely. You would need to know HTML, CSS and PHP; If you do, the job can largely be reduced to copy &amp; paste by downloading a theme for Shopp and then work through template file by template file, replacing the existing markup code with the one from you theme. But be aware that if Shopp has functionality that was not included in WP E-commerce, your theme will likely not have provided styles for it.</p>
