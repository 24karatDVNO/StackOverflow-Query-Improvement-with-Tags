<p>If you are going for encapsulation then you shouldn't provide direct access to complex objects (passed by ref). You should look at what it is you expect other classes to be able to do with your 'SomeClass'. If you really need to pass a whole class and don't want it to be a ref, then add a clone method. If you just expect other classes to update some data that belongs to 'SomeClass' the provide setters for that data and apply it directly to the 'SomeClass' instance. It does require more code, but will accomplish the goal of encapsulating your class.</p>
