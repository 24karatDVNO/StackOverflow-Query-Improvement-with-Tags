<p>You want to look into a 3d space-filling curve. A 3d sfc reduces the 3d complexity to a 1d complexity. It's a little bit like n octree or a r-tree. If you can store your full dna in a sfc you can look for similar tiles in the tree although a sfc is most likely to use with lossy compression. Maybe you can use a block-sorting algorithm like the bwt if you know the size of the tiles and then try an entropy compression like a huffman compression or a golomb code?</p>
