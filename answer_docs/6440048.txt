<p>Are the files in a directory that is served by your webserver? If all you want to do is list and download the files, it may be easier just to have a link to the directory with all the files in it and let the webserver take care of listing and serving the files. I understand this may not be the ideal solution for you, but it does avoid having Django serve static files, which is a task best left to the webserver.</p>
