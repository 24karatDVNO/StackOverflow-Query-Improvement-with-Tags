<p>One big disadvantage with this approach is often you will run into access violation issues if your startup project holds references to any dlls that other projects reference during the build, even if copy local = false.  I run into this issues everyday now.  I would suggest having a project with all the needed references and copy local = true for those references.  This will also help with making an installer.</p>
