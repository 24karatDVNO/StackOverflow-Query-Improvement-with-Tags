<p>Hey @Ptitaw see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6356857/how-do-i-know-if-my-client-ios-app-is-connected-to-the-server">this post</a>. I believe there you might find your answer and an easier way to connect and get access automatically to all events (reading, writing, etc..)
Hope I could help :)</p>
