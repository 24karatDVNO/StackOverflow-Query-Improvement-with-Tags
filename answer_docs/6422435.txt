<p>Possibly setting the default value of the 'phone' column to NULL would make it fail insertion because it would end up null if you did not specify it.</p>

<p>Otherwise you're going to need to omit the phone column for the default to kick in, say in php you'd use empty($phone) ? null : $phone; or something along those lines.</p>
