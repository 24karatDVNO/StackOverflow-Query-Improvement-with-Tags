<p>I don't know of anything that directly achieves matches what you are looking for.  I recently did a project on <a href="http://www.st.ewi.tudelft.nl/~peterz/papers/AZG_PRDC06.pdf" rel="nofollow">automated fault localization</a> where we needed this exact functionality, and the only solution we came up with was to roll our own test runner that also gathered coverage information for each method.  </p>

<p>There may be an indirect way to achieve this using Visual Studio 2010 (Premium and Ultimate), which introduced a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/phuene/archive/2009/12/07/test-impact-analysis-in-visual-studio-2010.aspx" rel="nofollow">Test Impact Analyzer</a>.  This allows you to determine which tests are affected changes to your source code.  However, this only works for MSTest.  You can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-gb/magazine/cc163643.aspx#S4" rel="nofollow">the technique in this blog post</a> to allow your NUnit tests to run under MSTest. </p>
