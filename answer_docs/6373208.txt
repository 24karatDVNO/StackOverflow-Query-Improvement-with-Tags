<p>Right now your adding easingFunction &amp; processFrame to the Global object (which isn't a good thing). Not that this is the cause of the problem, but I've found that mismanagement of my objects is the usual cause of memory leaks.</p>

<p>You'll want to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>var MyObject = {}; 

MyObject.easingFunction = function(){};
MyObject.processFrame = function(){};
</code></pre>

<p>In short make sure you declare all objects with <code>var</code> before using them. </p>
