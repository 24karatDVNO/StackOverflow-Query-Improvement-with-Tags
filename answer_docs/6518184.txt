<p>I agree with Charlee that there seems nothing wrong at first glance. But please clarify: What source folders are you missing?
And remember: At least in "java-mode" Eclipse sometimes hides certain foldes f.e. build targets and "duplicates" others in the view for convenience, here the different java-src folders.</p>
