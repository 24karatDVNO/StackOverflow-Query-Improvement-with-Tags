<p>You can take a look at <a href="http://swfupload.org/" rel="nofollow">SWFUpload</a>. It has a lot of good features like:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restricting the type of files the user can select in the dialog</li>
<li>Multi-file uploading</li>
<li>Ajax-like file uploads</li>
</ul>

<p>I am not, however, sure if it allows you to set the default directory. An initial look at the configuration options and the reference manual for the <code>Flash.net.File</code> class makes me think that it is not possible even with Flash. However, the file-type restriction might make life a little easier on your users.</p>

<p>Java Webstart may be worth looking into as well. However, you have to worry about application signing, warning messages, and other things.</p>
