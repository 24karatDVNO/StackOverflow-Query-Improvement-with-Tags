<p>I think the better approach is injecting an object. But why is ServiceObject there?
You have a method createArticle, then it would be logical to pass an article object to it, no?
In that way it is simplier to organize a validation process, you may just mark fields that you want to be validated in annotations.</p>

<p>Also it is a matter of approach you are using. If you use data mapper pattern in your service layers, then you should obviously pass an object to it.</p>

<p>With an object you have transparent and clear interface of communication between your objects.
With an array it is not quiet clear what type of data you transfer, what kind of fields and so on.</p>
