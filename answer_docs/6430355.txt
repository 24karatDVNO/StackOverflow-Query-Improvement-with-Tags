<p>The technique described by Brian Chess et. al. in the following paper might be of use in this case. In short you override the javascript setter that is used to process the incoming JSON.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the JSON array arrives on the
  client, it will be evaluated in the
  context of the malicious page. In
  order to witness the evaluation of the
  JSON, the malicious page has redefined
  the JavaScript function used to create
  new objects. In this way, the
  malicious code has inserted a hook
  that allows it to get access to the
  creation of each object and transmit
  the object's contents back to the
  malicious site.</p>
