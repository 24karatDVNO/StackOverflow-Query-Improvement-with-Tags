<p>Your views' text is centered manually by the margin. This approach isn't flexible as you can see. I'd remove those margins and set <code>landroid:layout_gravity="center"</code> instead. In addition, you should set the <code>android:layout_weight</code> for your <code>TextView</code>s <code>cal</code> and <code>cal1</code> like <code>0.6</code> and <code>0.4</code> respectively. Change the weight slightly if that doesn't fit you.</p>
