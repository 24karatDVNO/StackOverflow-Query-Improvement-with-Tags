<p>It is possible through the native (read: unofficial, unsupported) API - each device has its own, and I know that on my Dell Venue Pro I can lock any physical key on the device. As of virtual (software) keys - you cannot lock them through the SDK and all you can do is handle events as keystrokes are sent from the keyboard to the receiver (e.g. a TextBox control).</p>
