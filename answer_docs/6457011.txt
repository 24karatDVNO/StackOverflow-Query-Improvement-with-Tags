<p>It seem to be a general problem of java on memory limits set by cluster manager.
We are encounter this problem with SGE on Fedora Core 13.
see <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=510344" rel="nofollow">bug on fedora</a>
Solution is to set limits to ~ 4 Go (not easy all the time ...)
or set environment </p>
