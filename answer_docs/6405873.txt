<p>I suppose it would be something like</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementsByTagName("fb\:login-button")[0].click();
</code></pre>

<p>I'm sure that would work very well with a "normal" DOM element that handles the click event; however, I'm not entirely sure it will work in all browsers with the fb:login-button element shimmed into HTML. You'll have to let me know.</p>
