<p>Unless you can provide more information we can only make the most general "<a href="http://samizdat.mines.edu/howto/HowToBeAProgrammer.html#id2790282" rel="nofollow">How Do I  Debug</a>"-type suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you duplicate the problem? If so,  run the app in a debugger.</li>
<li>If you can't duplicate the problem you will have to get your users to do so. You should make a special debug version of your app that logs what it is doing periodically. Get your users to trigger the error and send you the log.</li>
<li>Narrow down what is causing the problem by removing sections of code, or building test app with only the suspect sections of code.</li>
<li>Do not presuppose what is causing the problem. Do you have any evidence this is a WPF or WinForms error? Why do you "believe this error is not thrown by application code "? You need evidence, not guesses.</li>
</ul>
