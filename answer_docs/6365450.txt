<p>I'm not exactly sure if this is what you're looking for, but all you have to do is create a notification object (<code>mOngoingNote</code> below) and call <code>startForeground</code> using a notification ID along with the actual notification.</p>

<pre><code>    startForeground(NOTEMAN_ID, mOngoingNote);
</code></pre>
