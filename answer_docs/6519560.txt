<p>Well, you may want to consider to create a special layout for your error pages. After all, it's a common practice to make error pages clearly distinguishable from normal ones.</p>

<p>But I don't understand why your before filters defined in application controller don't trigger. They really should trigger <strong>before</strong> any error happens in your actions. 
Could you provide us with some code from your application controller?</p>
