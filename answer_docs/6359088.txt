<p>There are a few ways you can handle this. First you could have a section for the "Next" buttons that will only show if the correct users open the form. This way the requester would not be able to see the next 2 views. The other way to approach if you want the requester to be able to see the other two sections would be to create two extra views where the information is read only and have the other views that are not read only accessible to the correct users. The basic idea would be to create a formatting rule where it would hide and show sections depending upon which user is viewing the form. </p>
