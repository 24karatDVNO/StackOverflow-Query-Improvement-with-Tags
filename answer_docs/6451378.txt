<p>I agree with mtyson. Get started on checking your site in IE9 now. I manage many sites for a client and we are noticing a lot of problems in IE9. While it works fine in FF/Chrome/IE8 it is sometimes not displaying elements on the screen at all. Of course you can hit the compatibility mode, but to me that's not a solution. I am making sure our developers are aware of all problems in 9 now rather than next year when more people are using it and the sites are broken. </p>
