<p>I completely reinstalled Xcode 4 and that seemed to do the trick. But I must say I am quite paranoid when I open up projects. I have the impression that if I use the wrong version of Xcode with the wrong project this problem will come back. </p>

<p>Any illumination on this bug would be greatly appreciated. </p>
