<p>All browsers I test support Anti-Aliasing in the canvas, just put the image on an non integer coords to see it happening. But none subpixel rendering (for clarification, that is using LCDs ordering of red, green, blue subpixels to enhance horizontal resolution, great for text.)</p>

<p>According to the html5 pre-standard, its up to the browser to decide if it wants to do anti-aliasing or not.</p>
