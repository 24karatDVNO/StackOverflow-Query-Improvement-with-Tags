<p>As a few others have said, you'll need to alias the names in your Stored Procedure and they have given you examples on how to do so.  Alternatively, you can SELECT INTO a temp table and name them what you would like and then have your code pull from the temp table without any aliasing needed on the code-side. However, there is no getting around having to alias the stored procedure. Good Luck!</p>
