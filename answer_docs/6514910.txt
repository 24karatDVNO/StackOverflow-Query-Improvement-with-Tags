<p>I don't think you want to sanitize it. Sanitizing strips HTML, leaving the text behind, except for the HTML elements you deem OK. It is intended for allowing a user-input field to contain some markup.</p>

<p>Instead, you probably want to parse it. For example, the following will print the text content of the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags in a given html string.</p>

<pre><code>doc = Nokogiri::HTML.parse(html)

doc.search('p').each do |el|
  puts el.text
end
</code></pre>
