<p>You need to initialize the string. Right now any initialization or assignment is being performed within an if block. The compiler is detecting this and considering it possibly never initialized.</p>

<pre><code>string st = string.Empty;
</code></pre>

<p>As a side note, it is much safer to use the sister methods TryParse() for conversations to ensure that you won't have any unexpected exceptions thrown due to a invalid formatting issue.
The method will return true if it is converted successfully, which makes a clean look as such:</p>

<pre><code>        if (dt!=null)
        {
           if(dt.rows.count&gt; 0)
           {
              st = dt.Rows[3]["timeslot_StartTime"].ToString();
           }
        }

        DateTime dt = DateTime.MinValue;
        if (DateTime.TryParse(st, out dt))
        {
            //was successful and do something here
        }
</code></pre>
