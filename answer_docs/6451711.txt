<p>mm i can't seem to find the default function to reset the size thus <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/dfVDv/" rel="nofollow">i just manually set the div height back to zero.</a></p>

<pre><code>$("#divTest").height('0');
</code></pre>

<p>so if this is the way you're going with and you want to keep more complicated behavior, then i would think you would to manually keep the previous height, width, etc into variables and manually set them again depending on the event triggered.</p>
