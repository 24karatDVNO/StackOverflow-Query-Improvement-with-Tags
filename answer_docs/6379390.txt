<p>From what I understand about Complex analysis this is not an elementary graphics task. If you want to really illustrate your transformation you're gonna need to show your whole space warping, your coordinate lines bending (but staying perpendicular!), and a whole mess of other tasks.</p>

<p>I found this site with some animations:

<p>It says they were made in Mathematica. Maybe try there? I don't know if Python is what you're looking for.</p>
