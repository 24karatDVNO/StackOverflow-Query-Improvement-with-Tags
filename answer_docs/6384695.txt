<p>If many lines <i>do not</i> contain an E-mail address, how about a quick pre-test before applying the RE:</p>

<pre>if ( my $ix = index( $line, '@' ) &gt; 0 )
{   #test E-mail address here
    . . .
    #and another wild idea you could try to cut down lengths of strings actually parsed:
    my $maxLength = 100;     #maximum supported E-mail address length (up to the @)
    if ( substr( $line, MAX( $ix - $maxLength, 0), $maxLength ) =~ /YourRE/ )
}</pre>

<p>(yes, &gt;   any line starting with a @ can not be an E-mail address)</p>
