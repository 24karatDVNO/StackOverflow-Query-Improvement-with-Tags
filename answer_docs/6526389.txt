<p>This kind of logic should be in the <code>render</code> method of a snippet. Display code in pure Scala (rather than in a template language hybrid) is a first-class citizen with respect to testing, IDE's and refactoring tools.</p>

<p>These kinds of transforms don't come built-in, but you can add them with implicits:</p>

<pre><code>class HappyString(s: String) {
  def capfirst = ....
}

implicit def toHappyString(s: String) = new HappyString(s)
</code></pre>

<p>Then call these in your <code>render</code> method before binding whatever value it is you're generating.</p>
