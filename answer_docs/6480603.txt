<p>Your problem is that you are subtracting the 9-bit <code>111010000</code> from the 10-bit <code>1111011111</code>. The two's complement of <code>111010000</code> is <code>...11111000110000</code>, where the dots are trying to show that you have to pad to the left with as many <code>1</code> bits as you need. Here, you need 10 bits, so the two's complement of <code>111010000</code> is not <code>000110000</code> but <code>1000110000</code>.  </p>

<p>So you want to calculate <code>1111011111 + 1000110000 = 11000001111</code>, which you just truncate to 10 bits to get the correct answer <code>1000001111</code>.</p>
