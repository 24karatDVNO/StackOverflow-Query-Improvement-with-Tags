<p>Ok worked it out my self over the weekend</p>

<p>1)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT sum(value1), sum(value2) FROM TickData AS a,
(SELECT USERID, PRODID, DATE(TIME) AS JUSTDATE, MAX(TIME) AS MTIME
FROM TickData
GROUP BY 1,2,3
) AS b
WHERE a.USERID = b.USERID
AND a.TIME = b.MTIME
AND STRFTIME('%Y-%m',a.TIME) = STRFTIME('%Y-%m','NOW')
AND a.USERID = 1
GROUP BY JUSTDATE
</code></pre>

<p>2)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT sum(Mval) FROM TickData AS a,
(SELECT USERID, PRODID, DATE(TIME) AS JUSTDATE,ID, MAX(value1) AS Mval
FROM TickData
GROUP BY 1,2,3
) AS b
WHERE a.USERID = b.USERID
AND a.ID = b.ID
AND STRFTIME('%Y-%m',a.TIME) = STRFTIME('%Y-%m','NOW')
AND a.USERID = 2
GROUP BY JUSTDATE
</code></pre>

<p>3)</p>

<pre><code>SELECT sum(Mval) FROM TickData AS a,
(SELECT USERID, PRODID, DATE(TIME) AS JUSTDATE,ID, MIN(value1) AS Mval
FROM TickData
GROUP BY 1,2,3
) AS b
WHERE a.USERID = b.USERID
AND a.ID = b.ID
AND STRFTIME('%Y-%m',a.TIME) = STRFTIME('%Y-%m','NOW')
AND a.USERID = 2
GROUP BY JUSTDATE
</code></pre>

<p>Edit:
2 and 3 can be done with one query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT sum(Mval), sum(Mval2) FROM TickData AS a,
(SELECT USERID, PRODID, DATE(TIME) AS JUSTDATE,ID, MAX(PL) AS Mval,MIN(PL) AS Mval2
FROM TickData
GROUP BY 1,2,3
) AS b
WHERE a.USERID = b.USERID
AND a.TIME = b.MTIME
AND STRFTIME('%Y-%m',a.TIME) = STRFTIME('%Y-%m','NOW')
AND a.USERID = 2
GROUP BY JUSTDATE
</code></pre>
