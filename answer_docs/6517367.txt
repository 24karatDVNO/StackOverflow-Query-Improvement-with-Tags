<p>swami did you give the action method in the .h file? Try declaring the method in .h and its implementation in .m and also make sure that you define the button name in .h file ex: IBOutlet UIButton buttonName;
save it and try doing it by assigning action as touchupinside or any else it should work.</p>

<p>hope it helps you. </p>
