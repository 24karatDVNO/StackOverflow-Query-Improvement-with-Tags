<p>You have choices with <code>UILabel</code>, you could either use an <code>single line</code> or <code>multiline</code>  using <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UILabel_Class/Reference/UILabel.html#//apple_ref/occ/instp/UILabel/lineBreakMode" rel="nofollow">lineBreakMode</a> , this mode will determine the performance of your <code>UILabel</code>.</p>

<p>There is not direct answer for your questions because it's not visible to us how apple have implemented the UILabel. </p>

<p>If showing the complete text is not in your requirement, you could only pass the 20%  of the string and can be considered as optimization.</p>
