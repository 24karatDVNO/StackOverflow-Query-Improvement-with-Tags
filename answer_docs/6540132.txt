<p>I assume you want the user to be able to go to /[username] but actually serve the page /user_profile.aspx?username=[username],  correct?</p>

<p>You're not going to be able to do this in javascript. You need to do this on the server with <a href="http://google.com/?q=url%20rewrite%20iis" rel="nofollow">Url Rewrite</a> on IIS.</p>
