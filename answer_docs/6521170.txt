<p>Solution was a custom object to associate the 'range' parameter I required with the other two 'address' and 'name', this meant listing all required values. In order to retrieve the desired values a base addressed was calculated from this by comparing the range of each address, the results then stored.</p>

<p>Apologies for the vague nature of this question :P</p>
