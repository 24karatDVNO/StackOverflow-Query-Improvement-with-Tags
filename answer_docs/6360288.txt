<p>To do that you'll need to have an instance of that <code>Form</code> outside of those methods that you dismply show if the <code>Form</code> has already been created, or create and show it if it has not (this is the singleton pattern). Here's an example:</p>

<pre><code>Form1 f2 = null;

private void addRecordsToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (f2 == null)
    {
         f2 = new Form1();
         f2.MdiParent = this;
         f2.button1.Enabled = true;
    }
    f2.Show();
}

private void updateRecordsToolStripMenuItem_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (f2 == null)
    {
        f2.MdiParent = this;
        f2.button2.Enabled = true;
        f2.button1.Enabled = false;
    }
    f2.Show();
}
</code></pre>

<p>One question on your disabling of the menu items though, how do you plan on re-enabling them after they have been disabled?</p>
