<p>Off the top of my head, you can try overlaying the map with a square grid with each grid square being 106 miles by 106 miles.  Then create your circles based on the center of the grid square with your 75 mile radius which should be very close to the vertices of the square intersecting the perimeter of the circle.  I don't know if this will give you the absolute minimum overlap but is a starting point that provides 100% coverage of the area.</p>
