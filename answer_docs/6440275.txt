<p>When you create a task, under the "Edit Action" properties, there is a field "Start In (Optional)"  It is not optional.  It is critical this is populated with the path to the program you are executing. if it is not your scheduled task will fail... It seems redundant but it fixes the issue.</p>

<p>Thanks Microsoft.</p>
