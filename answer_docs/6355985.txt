<p>Answering my own question:</p>

<p>I seem to have found a solution to the problem here:</p>

<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/archive/2007/10/19/loading-the-wcf-configuration-from-different-files-on-the-client-side.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://weblogs.asp.net/cibrax/archive/2007/10/19/loading-the-wcf-configuration-from-different-files-on-the-client-side.aspx</a></p>

<p>In summary this allows you to specify a custom configuration file that contains the WCF configuration as it is generated by Visual Studio - this means that the config can be maintained easily.</p>

<p>Having run a couple of quick tests it seems that it works as it should (with a few tweaks here and there (see the comments on the page).</p>
