<p>Well there is no single solution to this so I'll provide some technologies that will be useful for you (I assume from the tag that you are using Java environment on server).</p>

<p>As for the confirm box, In case you mean something like DHTML confirm boxes that are commonly seen on Facebook, you might want to use jQuery UI component. Have a look at this :

<p>You can also use javascript confirm function, but these boxes are currently in vogue.</p>

<p>As far as updating the database is considered, of course that has to be done from server side. You can set a Servlet to do the deletion or a web service for the same. It just is a matter of passing right parameters.</p>
