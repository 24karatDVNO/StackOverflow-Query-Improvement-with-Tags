<p>By default ASP.Net doesn't provide a datetime picker. </p>

<p>Usually people develop their own controls in Javascript. In .Net you can create your own composite control with date and time pick ability. </p>

<p>Otherwise you may go for some free .Net/JS controls provided by 3rd parties. There are many vendors providing date picker control.</p>
