<p>It depends on what you want to do/ what you understand under threadsafe.
Normally you dont want threads to access the same data concurrently so you serialize this.
But this means if one thread is in the function all others have to wait. This is called a mutex(mutual exclusion).
The other way would be to have multiple threads in the function but a limited number.
There you could apply a semaphore.</p>

<p>So what do you want to do?</p>
