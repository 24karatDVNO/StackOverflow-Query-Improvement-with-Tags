<p>You need to elaborate on what you mean by 'look' and 'network'. A network could be anything. Do you mean devices on the same subnet as yours? Probably on the same Ethernet cable? </p>

<p>There are scanners that can scan your subnet and spew out a list of IP addresses that respond to an ICMP echo (Ping). </p>

<p>You could take a look at 'nmap' too if you want to get additional information about these devices. </p>
