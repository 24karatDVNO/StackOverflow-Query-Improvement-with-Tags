<p>Javascript is a much faster way since you do not need to send a request to the server. </p>

<p>But it depends if you are validating a form with certain data that you need checked. </p>

<p>For example, if you have a form and there is an email input box, you may want to check if that email is already in your database. This would require php.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you do not need to make a request to your server, javascript would be the better one to use.</p>
