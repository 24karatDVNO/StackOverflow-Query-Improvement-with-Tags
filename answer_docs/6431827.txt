<p>I would recommend taking a look at <a href="http://vaadin.com/home" rel="nofollow">Vaadin</a>.  It uses GWT for the UI but works on the server side and can be easily embedded as a portlet.  I know that works <a href="http://www.liferay.com/web/guest/community/wiki/-/wiki/Main/Developing+Vaadin+Applications+as+Liferay+Portlets" rel="nofollow">extremely well for Liferay</a> as I've personally written Vaadin (GWT) apps and deployed them as portlets in liferay.  Additionally, Vaadin <a href="http://vaadin.com/book/-/page/advanced.portal.html" rel="nofollow">states here</a> that it will support JSR-168 compliant portals like Pluto.</p>
