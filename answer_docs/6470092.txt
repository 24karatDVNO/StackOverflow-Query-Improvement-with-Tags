<p>You can't multiply a datetime by a double, but you can set a value for date1 and date2 on a scale (1 to 100) and figure out where the value you would be in the middle. The 1 versus 100 ends up on 50 in your 50/50 scenario. </p>

<p>You then have to figure the number of days in the range. You can then multiply by the weighted decimal (as a percent) and turn that into number of days. Then add that number of days to the first value.</p>

<p>Since you can turn dates into numbers, this gives some pretty interesting other means of accomplishing this. A TimeSpan is one way of setting this up as a number.</p>
