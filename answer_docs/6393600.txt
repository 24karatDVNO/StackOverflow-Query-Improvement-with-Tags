<p>Your table's delegate will get a <code>-tableView:didSelectRowAtIndexPath:</code> message when a row is selected. It can then call the table's <code>-reloadRowsAtIndexPaths:withAnimation:</code> method to reload the selected row. The data source will be asked for that cell again, and the data source can return a cell configured so that the article text is visible.</p>
