<p>I am not sure that this is the correct answer. I made the following changes. I am not sure which one corrected my problem.</p>

<p>1)It seems there must be a environment variable called as QTDIR which points to the dynamic installation dir. </p>

<p>2)I compiled the qt libs for static build using "visual studio" rather than "mingw".</p>

<p>After these steps I added the absolute paths of static and dynamic (qt-bin,lib,minwg-bin,lib) to the path.</p>

<p>Now, my things are working fine. I didn't vote it as a correct answer. Thereby some one can give the exact answer.</p>
