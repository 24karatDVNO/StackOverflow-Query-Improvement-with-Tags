<p>When I need messaging with fault tolerance (and/or guaranteed delivery, which based on your description I am guessing you also need), I usually turn to MSMQ. It provides both fault tolerance (messages are stored on disk in case of machine restart) and guaranteed delivery (messages will automatically and continually resend until they are received), as well as transactional sends and receives, message journaling, poison message handling, and other features.</p>

<p>I have been able to achieve a throughput of several thousand messages per second using MSMQ. Frankly, I am not sure that you will get too much better than that while still being fault tolerant.</p>
