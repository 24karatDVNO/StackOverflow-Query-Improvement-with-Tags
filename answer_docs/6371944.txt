<p>You could just concatenate the two strings together and do a normal sort on that value. It would give you the same result. Or if you can use link you could do:</p>

<pre><code>myObjectList.OrderBy(p =&gt; p.LastName).ThenBy(p =&gt; p.FirstName);
</code></pre>

<p>There are also OrderByDescending and ThenByDescending methods as well.</p>
