<p>I'm just re-iterating what others have said already, but this point cannot be over-stated: DO NOT USE REGEXES TO PARSE HTML. There are a 1,000 similar questions on this on SO. Use a proper HTML parser, it will make your life so much easier, and is far more robust and reliable. Take a look at Dom4j, Jericho, JSoup. Please.</p>
