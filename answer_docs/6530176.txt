<p>There is definitely an issue with how the thumb is being drawn.   Running under Windows 7/64, the slider thumb moves horribly.  The thumb is drawn using the fancy Aero-mode theme modules and such out of the box;  So on a hunch I fired up Blend and dropped in the "SimpleSlider", which is just a regular  with a completely custom and self contained Style and Template.   Once I did this, the thumb began moving very smoothly.</p>

<p>You could go the route of trying the SimpleSlider style, or roll your own template from scratch.</p>
