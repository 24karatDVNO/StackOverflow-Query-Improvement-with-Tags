<p>well, there is no easier way, you could use <code>param</code> feature, but it is risky as well. </p>

<p>have a look at example for <code>string.Format()</code> where you can use it like:</p>

<pre><code>stringA.Format("{0} is {1}", str1, str2)
</code></pre>

<p>that way you can pass any number of params, but it is quite tricky how u consume it and could be quite error prone</p>
