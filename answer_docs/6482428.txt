<p>Windows Explorer view is always going to show you all the files so there isn't going to be a way to make it show a subset of the files.  With a tool written to use the SharePoint web services you could access a document library view that only had approved documents showing so you could only download documents that showed up in the view.  Alternatively you could query the document library for items that were approved and just grab those.</p>
