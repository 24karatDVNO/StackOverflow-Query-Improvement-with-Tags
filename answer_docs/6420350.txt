<p>I think this is an unfortunate interaction between:</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/d14azbfh%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">first-chance exceptions</a>, and</li>
<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/h5e30exc.aspx" rel="nofollow">"Just My Code"</a></li>
</ol>

<p>Maybe it's just me but "Just My Code" isn't that useful because I always want to see <strong>all the code</strong> in stack traces, etc.!  But it <strong>is</strong> nice for filtering and simplifying.</p>

<p>I believe that you'll have to turn off "Just My Code" in order to prevent "User-unhandled" exceptions like this because it's literally true that what Visual Studio considers "your code" isn't handling the exception.</p>
