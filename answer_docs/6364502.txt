<p>Presorting doesn't work when you have many points in the application where things get added to the ListBox. You can add an event handler when it gets updated. Pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>import com.google.gwt.event.dom.client.ChangeHandler;

ChangeHandler sortMyList(){

    //extract your elements, sort, then reinsert
}

ListBox lb = new ListBox();
lb.addChangeHandler( sortMyList());
</code></pre>

<p>The other alternative is to extend ListBox to a class called SortedListBox which keeps elements sorted as they are inserted. This would avoid O(n^2) amortized insertion cost.</p>
