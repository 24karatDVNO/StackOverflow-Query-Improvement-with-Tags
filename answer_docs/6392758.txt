<p>Remove the <code>$</code> from your 'shemale' comparison.  </p>

<p>That's causing your script to fail as it's looking for a non-existent variable.</p>

<pre><code>        var genderdb = "&lt;?php echo $genderdb; ?&gt;";
        if ((genderdb == "Female") || (genderdb == "Shemale")) {
            var himher = "her";
        } else {
            var himher = "him";
        }
        alert (himher);
</code></pre>
