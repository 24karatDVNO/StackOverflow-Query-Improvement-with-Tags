<p>It's not an exact match to your situation, but a good tool is the <a href="http://wp7explorer.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Windows Phone 7 IsolatedStorage Explorer</a>.</p>

<p>The reason I say it may not be the best match is this note from the <a href="http://wp7explorer.codeplex.com/documentation" rel="nofollow noreferrer">documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The WP7 Isolated Storage Explorer
  supports connections from the emulator
  or actual devices. For applications
  running on devices a data connection
  must be enabled (WiFi or the mobile
  data connection).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's at least a great start and keeps you from having to do the heavy lifting. Is there any reason you have to be offline and check the contents of IsolatedStorage? If you elaborate on why you have that requirement, we might be able to offer some work arounds.</p>
