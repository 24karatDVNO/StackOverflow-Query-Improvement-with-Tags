<p>I've been losing faith to the whole source control community.
Everyone is saying VSS is hell bad, likes those old bias, C++ is way better than C, Win Vista is terrible and XP is too old to serve the world. Yet still lots of people using them.
You never know how you would like a tool before you use it. And every version control application consists of bugs and defects.
And VSS is just so difficult to drop.</p>
