<p>You could write an extension method to call on the dataColumn. It wouldn't functionally be much different than your CheckNull method, though.</p>

<p>Or in your first example with str1, str2, strN and such, is there a reason you can't reuse str1 for each? I see you have a method call in your long line of code, you wouldn't want to waste the time running that more often than you need to (especially if it's going to result in the same output every time).</p>
