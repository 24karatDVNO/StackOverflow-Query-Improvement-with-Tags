<p>For the <code>Amt</code> property you have used the bindings file to override how a JAXB implementation will handle that value.  This will result in the generation of an <code>XmlAdapter</code>.  The <code>XmlAdapter</code> will only be invoked during marshal/unmarshal operations are called, and not when get/set are called.</p>
