<p>I have given a similar answer before but I could not find it. So I will just repeat what I have said before. </p>

<p>You need to use <strong>signal/slot</strong> mechanism of qt to make communication happen between main thread with a worker thread.</p>

<p>Checkout the <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/threads-mandelbrot.html" rel="nofollow">Mandelbrot example</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
