<p>You don't stop a BroadcastReceiver.. you may try using a Service instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>public abstract void onReceive (Context context, Intent intent)</p>
<p>Since: API Level 1
This method is called when the BroadcastReceiver is receiving an Intent broadcast. During
this time you can use the other methods on BroadcastReceiver to view/modify the current
result values. The function is normally called within the main thread of its process, so
<strong>you should never perform long-running operations</strong> in it (there is a timeout of 10 seconds that
the system allows before considering the receiver to be blocked and a candidate to be
killed). You cannot launch a popup dialog in your implementation of onReceive().</p>
