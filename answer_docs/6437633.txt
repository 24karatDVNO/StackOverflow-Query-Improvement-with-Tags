<p>I worked it out. it was silly really. as an anonymous user the login text boxes were obviously there and because of the fixed positioning the main menu was pushed out of view at the bottom of the screen. I removed the login block since it is only for admin and use the url instead and now the page looks the same to guests as it does to me. thanks for ur help</p>
