<p>Alright even this thread is old, i found out the answer. It's not the problem of CompressFormant.JPEG or CompressFormat.JPG. Simply put, intent in android isn't designed to carry big data like image from activity through activity. I need to save the image from intent to sd card first before able to pull it out from there. It's my solution.</p>
