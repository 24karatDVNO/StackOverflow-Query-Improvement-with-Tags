<p>Use <code>android:gravity="center"</code> in a TableRow.</p>

<p>The following ideas are not elegant. Just for reference.</p>

<p>Use RelativeLayout.
Create an invisible control as Layout centerHorizontal.
Then use Layout toLeftOf and toRightOf to this control to make the controls to the left or right to the center.
Maybe the "control" must be a layout.</p>

<p>Another way, to use TableLayout inside a RelativeLayout, if your controls are measured in dip's.
Use center_horizontal in RelativeLayout, and specify TableLayout's width just big enough for the two controls. Then put the controls in a TableRow.</p>
