<p>In Grails 1.4 release notes, they claim to have increased their support of hot code reload.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reloading Agent</p>
  
  <p>There is a new JVM-agent that handles
  reloading of classes making it
  possible to reload changes to domain
  classes, statically typed services and
  more cases that weren't supported
  before.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of grails 1.3.7 and before, there are a number of things that force you to restart your grails application : Changes to domain classes, commands, configs and xml files.</p>

<p>Maybe upgrading to 1.4 M2 will solve your problem.</p>
