<p>First I don`t really get the point of your question. But I just trying to to help, or you can be more specific :D. Are you sure you have added phonegap.js in your project? As far as I know to make phonegap API working, you have to add phonegap.js in your html page. Then you can access hardware through phonegap API.</p>
