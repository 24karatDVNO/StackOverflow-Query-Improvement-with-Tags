<p>Try this </p>

<pre><code>dateparam1.Value = dt_From.Value.ToShortDateString();
dateparam2.Value = dt_To.Value.ToShortDateString();
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise have look at this :</p>

<p>Date values must be either delimited according to the ODBC canonical date format or delimited by the datetime delimiter ("#"). Otherwise, Microsoft Access will treat the value as an arithmetic expression and will not raise a warning or error.</p>

<p>For example, the date "March 5, 1996" must be represented as {d '1996-03-05'} or #03/05/1996#; otherwise, if only 03/05/1993 is submitted, Microsoft Access will evaluate this as 3 divided by 5 divided by 1996. This value rounds up to the integer 0, and since the zero day maps to 1899-12-31, this is the date used.</p>

<p>A pipe character (|) cannot be used in a date value, even if enclosed in back quotes.</p>
