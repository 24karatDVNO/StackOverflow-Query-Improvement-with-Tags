<p>It may be that you're observing the effects of a "smart" allocator that asks the OS for big chunks of memory and suballocates. You might check by replacing the global <code>operator new</code> and <code>operator delete</code>. If those tell you that all allocated memory is also deallocated, and yet the process' memory consumption goes up or stays up there, then it's (most probably) the allocator.</p>
