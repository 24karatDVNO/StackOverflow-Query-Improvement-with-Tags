<p>You can also leave the ' arround the date-parameter</p>

<pre><code>tableName.DateInTable&gt; @ReportDateParameter
</code></pre>

<p>That's what works for me in a project.</p>

<p>Sorry - just saw that your sql is linked together - therefore your DateParameter has to be converted to string - as mentioned by the answer above.</p>
