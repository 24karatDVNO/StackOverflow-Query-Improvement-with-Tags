<p>Actually, even what you have done will not show the rows it updated, because meanwhile (after the update) some process may add/change rows.</p>

<p>And this will show all the records, including the ones updated yesterday :)</p>

<p>If I want to see exactly which rows were changed, I would go with temp table. First select into a temp table all the row IDs to be updated. Then perform the update based on the raw IDs in the temp table, and then return the temp table.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE to_be_updated
SELECT id
FROM myTable
WHERE someVal = 1;

UPDATE myTable
SET niceColumn = 1
WHERE id IN (SELECT * FROM to_be_updated);

SELECT *
FROM myTable
WHERE id IN (SELECT * FROM to_be_updated)
</code></pre>
