<p>I have my wife setup with Windows LiveWriter</p>

<p>This means that she just builds her articles as if she is using a word processor (almost exactly the same) and then just uploads the article to her blog.  I use Blogengine.net to host the blog on a Godaddy hosting solution.  </p>

<p>Blogengine comes with built in support for LiveWriter and only required that you input the address, username and password in. </p>
