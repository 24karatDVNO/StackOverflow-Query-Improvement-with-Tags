<p>Applescript just automates what the application can already do on its own. So my question to you would be... can you populate that menu in Numbers? Of course Numbers populates the menu, but does Numbers give you the ability to determine what that menu holds. If not then there's no chance you can do it with applescript.</p>

<p>But you really don't need it. If you're running an applescript to generate the values then just popup a choose-from-list dialog box so you can choose the one you want to insert. Then after you choose one use applescript to insert the value into the currently selected cell in Numbers.</p>
