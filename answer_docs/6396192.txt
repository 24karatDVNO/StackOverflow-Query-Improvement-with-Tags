<p>Does this answer your question ?</p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function(){
    $('#yourDiv').click(function() {
        $('#yourForm').submit();
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>I have added a click handler on the "button div". When it is clicked it submits the form.
So you don't have to have a submit button in your form, just your div button</p>
