<p>I think you could use the <code>Select((e, idx) =&gt; new { Date = e.DateSampleTaken, Idx = idx})</code> "indexed" overload to get a list of (date, idx) pairs from your sorted list. If you have that you could cross-join it with "itself" in a way that idx2=idx1+1 and select the difference of the dates. I see a good chance that this will work with LINQ 2 objects. However, I have some doubts that any O/RM framework can translate such tricks to SQL. Usually the expression power of LINQ is much higher than what any O/RM can translate to SQL, but usually this turns out only if you try. On the other hand you could probably solve this in SQL similarly, if your database server allows selecting the row index in SQL.</p>
