<p>i think its better if you convert your array to string array and then perfrom the operation. Since when it comes to integer 09 and 9 has no difference the numeric values is what that matters. but when its a string its different so use string array to do the operation and if u have to just want to display it then string is better anyways. if u want integer then convert it into int, there are API available.</p>
