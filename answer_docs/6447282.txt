<p>Windowing functions were invented for this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SomeID, ModifiedUser, ModifiedDate FROM
( SELECT SomeID, ModifiedUser, ModifiedDate,
  row_number() over (PARTITION BY SomeID ORDER BY ModifiedDate DESC) AS rn
) AS subqry
WHERE rn=1;
</code></pre>

<p>If you want all rows in case of a tie, replace <code>row_number</code> by <code>rank</code>.</p>

<p>You don't mention choice of RDBMS. MySQL does not yet have this capability. Many others do.</p>
