<p>I have found several similar issues with silverlight:

<p>It looks there is no way to get mac address due to .net security settings except we do the following: </p>

<ol>
<li>Add Active-X Host site to "Trusted"</li>
<li>Call on client machine:
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\caspol.exe -machine
-quiet -addgroup Trusted_Zone -site acitve-x-host-site FullTrust -name
SecutityException -description "..."</li>
</ol>

<p>Finally I decided to rewrite Active-X to C++\ATL one. </p>
