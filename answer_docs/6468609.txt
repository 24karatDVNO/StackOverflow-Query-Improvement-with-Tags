<p>Assuming you have an IBOutlet named username hooked up to the username UITextField, and an IBOutlet named password hooked up to the password UITextField, add the following code:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewWillDisappear
{
    [username resignFirstResponder];
    [password resignFirstResponder];
}
</code></pre>

<p>this should then dismiss the keyboard when navigating to the next view</p>
