<p>It is trivial to implement a Linq-like extension method that works like a foreach loop (see e.g. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/200574/linq-equivalent-of-foreach-for-ienumerablet">this question</a>), but it has intentionally been left out of the Linq framework functions, because they are designed to be side-effect free. Therefore the way you are currently doing it is considered a better practice.</p>
