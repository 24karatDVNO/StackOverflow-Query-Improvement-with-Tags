<p>From MSDN:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before installing an application on a client computer, ClickOnce will examine the client to ensure that it has certain requirements specified in the application manifest. These include the following:</p>
  
  <p>The minimum required version of the common language runtime, which is specified as an assembly dependency in the application manifest.</p>
  
  <p>The minimum required version of the Windows operating system required by the application, as specified in the application manifest using the  element. (See  Element (ClickOnce Application))
  The minimum version of any and all assemblies that must be preinstalled in the global assembly cache (GAC), as specified by assembly dependency declarations in the assembly manifest.
  ClickOnce can detect missing prerequisites, and you can install prerequisites by using a bootstrapper. For more information, see How to: Install Prerequisites with a ClickOnce Application.</p>
