<p>Almost all objects in C# are constructed on the heap, and are accessed via pointers. The <code>.</code> is used almost like <code>-&gt;</code> in C++. IMHO its just works more naturally.</p>

<p>When thinking about the "pointers", a collection doesn't contain data, it references data.</p>

<p>So in your example, it will just work as you described it. </p>
