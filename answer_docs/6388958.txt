<p>The <code>showHUDAddedTo:animated:</code> and <code>showWhileExecuting:</code> methods are mutually exclusive. You can't use both methods to show the HUD . </p>

<p>Change your initializer to just allocate a HUD and it should work. </p>

<pre><code>HUD = [[MBProgressHUD alloc] initWithView:self.navigationController.view];
</code></pre>
