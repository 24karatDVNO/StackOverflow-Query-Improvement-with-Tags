<p>Servlet, JSP and JPA (used for data storage) are covered in the SCEA exam (now: Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 5 Enterprise Architect).</p>

<p>This is an exam to check your architecture skills. Even when Hibernate is not directly covered , JPA annotations are checked. These annotations can be used with Hibernate too. So proving your skills with JPA proves somehow your skills with Hibernate.</p>

<p>Please have in mind, this is a very top-level exams. You'll need to know lots about everything. It is also consisting of three parts.</p>

<p>Struts 2 is not covered by the exams. But you could prove your web skills with this exam:</p>

<p>Oracle Certified Expert, Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 6, JavaServer Pages and Servlet Developer

<p>It focuses on Servlets, JSP and such. </p>

<p>You could also compare it with that one:
Oracle Certified Professional, Java EE 5 Web Component Developer
<a href="http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=322" rel="nofollow">http://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=322</a></p>

<p>I am sorry, but I can't tell what the actual difference between these two is.</p>

<p>The exam for persistence has already be named in this thread.</p>

<p>If I were you - shortly after the SCJP - I would NOT go with the Architects exam. In your case I would directly head over to the JSP/Servlet related exam. This is a very good starting point to learn about containers and get used to the Java EE world in general. After all, you can see immediately what you have developed - that is motivating. While persistence is really important, it is a little tricky if you do not know anything about containers.</p>

<p>Good luck!
