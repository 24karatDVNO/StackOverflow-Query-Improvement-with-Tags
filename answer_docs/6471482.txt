<p>Where I work, have the group is migrating over to TFS from DOORS mainily for requirements, specifications, etc.  They still use Perforce as the repository.  I have used most of the repositories out there and each one has there own quirks.</p>

<p>To answer your question - what is the problem your trying to solve?  Do you need a integrated solution to manage your documents, bugs, source control?  TFS gives you the integration portion so that each time you check in code you can tag it back to a bug, a requirement, a specification.  That is a great feature if your company uses a lot of process.  Sounds like to me that your a small shop and you really don't need that kind of process.  I would stick with what works until you grow bigger and your needs change.</p>
