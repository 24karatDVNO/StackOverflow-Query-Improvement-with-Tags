<p>I don't know VB, but it looks like you create a new bitmap memory in your for-loop above without freeing the memory in between.</p>

<p>Use <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php" rel="nofollow">Imagemagick</a> instead to extract images from tif and then operate on each of those instead.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>
