<p>We use the [AssemblyInitialize] / [AssemblyCleanup] attributes for project level test setup and cleanup code. We do this for two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>creating a test database</li>
<li>creating configuration files in a temp directory</li>
</ul>

<p>It works fine for us, although we have to be careful that each test leaves the database how it found it. Looks a little like this (simplified):</p>

<pre><code>[AssemblyInitialize]
public static void AssemblyInit(TestContext context)
{
    ConnectionString = DatabaseHelper.CreateDatabaseFornitTests();
}

[AssemblyCleanup]
public static void AssemblyCleanup()
{
    DatabaseHelper.DeleteDatabase(ConnectionString);
}
</code></pre>

<p>I do not know of a way to do this 'solution' wide (I guess this really means for the test run - across potentially multiple projects)</p>
