<p>Support for deploying WAR files with EJBs is fixed (but possibly not available; see the following text) in Geronimo 3.0, going by <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-5117" rel="nofollow">bug report 5117</a>. Going by this report, dependency injection in 2.2.1 is likely to fail.</p>

<p>There is <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/geronimo-user/201105.mbox/%3CBANLkTimxJwim9eii8a+0bvAawy1T8kyPcA@mail.gmail.com%3E" rel="nofollow">one report on the mailing list</a>, suggesting that Geronimo 3.0 M1 might be used for validating whether dependency injection works for EJBs deployed in a web-application; this is however against a query raised with respect to a failure on the same topic. Reproducing the salient contents of the mail:</p>

  <p>≈Åukasz:</p>
  
  <p>Geronimo is not able to inject @EJB
  into a servlet. Both SLSB and my
  serlvet are packaged in war. ... <strong>By
  looking at the release notes I know
  that EJB 3.1 is supported only
  partially</strong>. I take it that the part
  that is not yet implemented in
  deploying EJBs inside war package?</p>

  <p>Hmm, IIRC, <strong>the EJB injection should
  work in the M1 release, although it
  have some bugs in EJB 3.1
  integration.</strong> I would suggest to use
  the latest trunk codes (just update
  some codes to try to work around the
  address binding issue on the building
  machine, hopefully a snapshot build
  could be generated in the next round),
  as we got a much better TCK result
  comparing with M1 release. JCDI
  related packages are definitely
  included in the latest trunk build.</p>

<p>Going all of the above, 3.0 M1 would be the release to attempt this at the moment, but there is surely some possibility of this feature being absent (given that bug 5117 does not appeared to be in the list of fixed bugs in the release notes).</p>
