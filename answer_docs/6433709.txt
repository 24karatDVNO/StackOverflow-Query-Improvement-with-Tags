<p>Use WordPress to make your application, and contact WP-specialist bloggers to feature you as one of the "brave" ones to use WordPress. You could probably get a few good backlinks that way and some publicity.</p>

<p>Many people who back WordPress for any kind of website do so because they are highly invested in it (which happens when you spend a lot of time learning a technology). That's why you get a lot of strong opinions on questions like this. The way I see it, WordPress is just a compilation of a lot of PHP files, and if you know PHP, you know how to use that to your advantage. If it adds value (like you said, it has the membership functionality), without adding <em>too</em> much that is extraneous, then use it. Otherwise, keep it simple with CakePHP.</p>
