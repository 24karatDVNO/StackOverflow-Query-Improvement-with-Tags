<p>I think that if you need to tell the user that the password expires in so many days, you should make a page that appears after the login has been completed. </p>

<p>For example, if you have one page that is your login form, then after that it goes to another script that redirects to the home page on successful login. 
Instead of immediately redirecting, you could use <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="refresh" content="5; URL=/"&gt;</code> on the page to give the user five seconds to read the page and show how many days the user has until their password expires. 
But make sure the message is only shown after login, otherwise a hacker can read the contents of the login page to find out when their password needs changing.</p>
