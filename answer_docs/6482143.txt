<p>All you need is a button with a PUT request, that PUT's to the url /org/ID/join and /org/ID/leave. You can do this a few ways, but using jquery's ajax call allows you to <strong>both</strong> sent the PUT request, and define the callback function.</p>

<p>The callback function is where you will change the button's text from join to leave, and leave to join, as appropriate.</p>
