<p>I would suggest adding this data to the source you are using to bind to the GridView. So If you have a <code>ICollection&lt;Product&gt;</code> that you are binding to the GridView, add the Serial number to the product class.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could turn the <code>ICollection&lt;Product&gt;</code> into a <code>Dictionary&lt;int, Product&gt;</code> and bind the key to the Serial number column.</p>

<p>It's difficult to know what would suit without knowing how you are biding your data.</p>
