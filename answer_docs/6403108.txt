<p>1) I believe it's the first screen of your application, not the splash screen. This could include a loading screen (preferably with a ProgressBar) if you need to continue loading something.

<p>2) I've seen an app do exactly this. The user launches the app and if there's no connection, it displays a message and closes the app. As long as the user is aware that the app will shutdown because a data connection is required (but not found), it should be okay. </p>
