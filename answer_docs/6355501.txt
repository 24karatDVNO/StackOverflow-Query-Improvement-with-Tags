  <p>I was kinda hoping the height would

  container. Like, in the event we ever
  needed a 100 word title for some

  do it.</p>

<p>If I'm understanding this correctly and this is the real reason you are asking this question, just set #nav to "height:auto;" and, if you want it to be at least a certain height use something like "min-height:44px;"</p>
