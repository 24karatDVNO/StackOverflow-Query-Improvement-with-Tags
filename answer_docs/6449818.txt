<p>This is a double headed linked list. You can use it as both queue(first in first out), and as stack(last in first out). The pointer gHeadPtr is for popping the first element inserted and gTailPtr is popping the last element inserted. Think about when the list is blank. Both gHeadPtr and gTailPtr are null. Now the condition to find out if the list is blank is <code>if ( NULL == gHeadPtr )</code>. So when first element is to be inserted, you point the curPtr to the gHeadPtr. Once inserted, until you need to pop the first element there is no need to touch the gHeadPtr. For the first time even gTailPtr will point to curPtr. So when only one element is inserted both gHeadPtr and gTailPtr are pointed to the same element. When next element is inserted, gHeadPtr is untouched. The new element is added next to the gTailPtr and gTailPtr will point to new element. This is pretty much basic stuff about queue. Better to study about the data structures. </p>
