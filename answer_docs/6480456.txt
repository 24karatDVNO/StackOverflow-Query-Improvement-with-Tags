<p>your property articleTextView is getting the string "TESTING! TESTING!". If you can't see it on the UITextview you have on screen, it is because you hooked it up to an instance variable with the same name (articleTextView). You might want to remove the IBOutlet from the instance variable and put it on the property. @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITextView *articleTextView; you might not need to hook it up again. Hope this clears up a misunderstanding you probably have between ivars and properties.</p>
