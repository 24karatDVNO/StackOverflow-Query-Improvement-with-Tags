<p>A regular expression do match the date would be <code>(Mon|Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri|Sat|Sun), \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} at \d{2}:\d{2} (-)?\d{4}(\r\n|\r|\n)&gt; Reply ABOVE THIS LINE</code>.  I don't know Java but I imagine there is a RegEx match function which will return the character position of the match, if it finds one.  Otherwise the hack is to add a <code>.*$</code> to the end of the RegEx and use the replace function to replace the date and everything after it with nothing, leaving you with just the part you want.</p>
