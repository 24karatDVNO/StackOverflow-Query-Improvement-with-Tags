<p>Whenever anyone is dealing with table sorting, paging, etc I immediately refer them to <a href="http://www.DataTables.net" rel="nofollow">DataTables</a>.  It does this sort of sorting properly while maintaining the "zebra stripe" layout you're looking for. I have it working currently in my company's app and it's great.</p>

<p>The reason I always suggest this approach is for the extra features you get.  Sorting, Paging, Filtering, and results limiting, all via a table loaded to the dom or via JSON or AJAX datasources.  Plus, add in ThemeBuilder for quick styling and outstanding, well supported CSS and it makes a tool that can't be ignored.</p>
