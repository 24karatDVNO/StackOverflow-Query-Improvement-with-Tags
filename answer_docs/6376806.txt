<p>Starting from what alienhard said I managed to come up with an answer to my problem.</p>

<pre><code>rewritemap  PSTAT prg:/bin/pstat.pl
...skipping...
rewritecond ${PSTAT:$site:$1} =devel
rewriterule ^/images/(\d+)/(\w+) - [E=devel:1]

header set cache-control "no-cache" env=devel
header unset expires env=devel
</code></pre>

<p>(<code>/images/(\d+)</code> is the folder of images for a particular project number <code>(\d+)</code>)</p>

<p>The <code>E</code> flag of <code>rewriterule</code> lets you set an environment variable in the case that the rule matches.  <code>-</code> doesn't actually rewrite anything.  Thus, this checks the output of the script using <code>rewritecond</code> sending it the project number from the <code>rewriterule</code>, and then sets the environment variable in the case that both conditions match.  Then <code>header</code> conditionally gets set based on the presence of that environment variable.</p>
