<p>Thanks guys for the suggestions.</p>

<p>Ended up posting the same question on the jQuery forum. Answer was to specifiy the <em>items</em> option on the sortable initialize to select all but the first row:</p>

<pre><code>$('table').sortable({items: 'tr:not(:first)'});
</code></pre>

<p>And this works perfectly ...</p>
