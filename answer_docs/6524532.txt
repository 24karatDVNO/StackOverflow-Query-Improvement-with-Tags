<p>Make velocity static and have a static method to update it. This way, you can still make instances of particle and update the velocity for all of them.</p>

<pre><code>var particle = function() {
  // particle stuff
}
particle.velocity = 1;
particle.updateVelocity = function(newVelocity) {
  this.velocity = newVelocity
}
</code></pre>
