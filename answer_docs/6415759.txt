<p><strong>Alexa</strong> from 1 to 99,999,999. If one website scores 1 then it has a 100% score</p>

<p><strong>Google indexed pages</strong> (you need to know how many pages the site has to extract total) if indexed is close to total than they get 100%. If indexed are 30 out of 100 total pages then they get 30% obviously</p>

<p>Let's say that alexa total score possible is 200 points and google total score possible is 200 points than we can do this math:</p>

<p>if they scored 70% in alexa then they score 140 here. If they scored 60% in Google indexed pages then they score 120. 140 + 120 = 260 total score.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways of doing this, you just need all the right numbers.</p>

<p>I hope I'm making sense lol.</p>
