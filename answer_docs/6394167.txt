<p>I've not worked with it, but the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/swing/text/GlyphView.GlyphPainter.html" rel="nofollow">GlyphView.GlyphPainter</a> class has <code>getAscent</code>, <code>getDescent</code> and <code>getHeight</code> methods. That might be something to check out.</p>
