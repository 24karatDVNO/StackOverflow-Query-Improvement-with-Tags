<p>I found that ImageView never gave me the framerates I was looking for (the reason, I don't know). For something like this you should override <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/SurfaceView.html" rel="nofollow">SurfaceView</a> instead. It's a bit more work, but you'll definitely see an improvement in the framerate and you'll have much more flexibility. Obviously you'll want to be aware of your clip and know that if any other view overlays this one, that will cause a significant slowdown as well (since the overlay will also need to be redrawn on each frame).</p>
