<p>For the serial port data acquisition see the <a href="http://www.granite.ab.ca/access/serialport.htm" rel="nofollow">Serial Port Communications</a> page at my web site.  Then you can write records to a table using a SQL Insert query or a DAO Recordset with an AddNew.    However finding the nearest matching record will likely require using of geometry to figure out the reading through the table looking for the closest location I'd have to refresh my memory as to the exact equations required.</p>

<p>I'm also thinking that to speed up the search you might want to index the latitude and longitude and start your search at nearby lat/longs.   That is limit the initial record set to plus/minus, for example, 0.1 of a lat/long which, just guessing would be about 10 kms square.</p>
