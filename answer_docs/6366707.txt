<p>I've worked on this problem myself. I'm fairly confident in saying that there is no easy way to do this, you just need to pick up a pen &amp; paper and dive into some fairly tedious trigonometry!</p>

<p>First thing to note is that the view's <code>frame</code> property is out of bounds (i.e. its value is undefined when a rotation transform is applied to it), so you must instead use the <code>bounds</code> and <code>center</code> properties. Then you just need to compute the new bounds and center position based on the current angle. The tedium comes in knowing that the <code>bounds</code> are not aligned to the horizontal &amp; vertical axis anymore, whereas the <code>center</code> coords of course are, hence the need for a pen &amp; paper. Your calculations will be very slightly different for each handle, however you can pretty much just get away with copying one handle's code and changing some plus/minus signs.</p>

<p>Actually to be honest, once you've braved the decision to do it, it's not too bad. My own implementation limited the size and width of the view being resized, and this was the hardest bit. Getting things to behave as the user would expect may take a bit of work, but it's worth it.</p>
