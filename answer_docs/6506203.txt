<p>The other variables defined shouldn't be string but part of an object such as... Description.
In this case, it would be easier, calling a Description->isEmpty() that returns true if one of those variables are empty.</p>

<p>If you are stuck with this configuration, you still can make an array:
$myArray=array($name, $category,...);
and check in a loop or maybe the return of in_array('',$myArray)</p>
