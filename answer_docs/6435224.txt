<p>You know, I was thinking the same thing...but then I came across the setOnTouchListener()... You can probably set this on your button or widget, and when the event status action = 1, it can start a timer to however long you want it. And when it reaches that time it will do something.</p>

<p>If you're creative enough, you can create a class to watch if the press has gone longer then certain time intervals, and if the action changes during that time you can fire your method up.</p>

<p>Hope this idea helps you.</p>
