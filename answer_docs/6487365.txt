<p>Even better than once per day, I think you need to refresh the client's cache whenever the javascript changes - or as an approximation, when you upgrade or restart the application. Not sure what's the best practice in PHP, but in Python I would generate a random upon application startup, store it in a global variable, and use that in every URL of the resources you provide, be it JS or CSS. Libraries like jQuery or YUI etc. only need to be reload when there's a new release, and you might want to serve them from a CDN.</p>
