<p>I use <a href="http://jupload.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Jupload</a></p>

<p>It splits the files and uploads them via http. It's also good because you don't need to care about file upload limitations in server config. Speed depends mostly on the client connection info both for HTTP and FTP. Of course there are some differences but not at all so big between them.</p>
