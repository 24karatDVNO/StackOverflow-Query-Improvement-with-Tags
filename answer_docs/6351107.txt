<p>My hunch is that coupling the common framework too closely with the separate versions will cause headaches. Perhaps this would work better:</p>

<pre><code>/-+
  |
  +--discovery/
  |  |
  |  +--index.php
  |  +--main.css
  |  +--main.js
  +--engine/
     |
     +--1.0-stable/
     |  |
     |  +--feature.php
     +--2.0-beta/
        |
        +--feature.php
</code></pre>

<p>The discovery section would manage a list of engine versions and their current state. Each engine version would be completely stand-alone. There's no direct link from the discovery section to the engine deployments, it's just a way to publicize which versions are currently running.</p>

<p>The deployments from version control would then be fairly standard to each engine version's directory.</p>
