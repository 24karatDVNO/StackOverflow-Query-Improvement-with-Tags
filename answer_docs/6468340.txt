<p>I do not understand the question fully. I do not work with Python, but know OpenCL quite well.</p>

<p>In OpenCL you have two possibilities to create shared/local memory buffers:</p>

<p>1) You add a kernel parameter as you have it in you question.
2) Do define a buffer statically within the kernel itself like:</p>

<pre><code>__local buffer[1024];
</code></pre>

<p>There are no other chances to do this with OpenCL. How you create the kernel code string to pass it to OpenCL is another question and related to Python. I am not an expert on this.</p>
