<p>Notepad++ it's very good text editor, but it's not IDE.<br>
Try to use IDE - <a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/" rel="nofollow">NetBeans</a> or <a href="http://confluence.jetbrains.net/display/WI/Web+IDE+EAP" rel="nofollow">PhpStorm</a>, and you will get much more than just smart autocomplete.</p>
