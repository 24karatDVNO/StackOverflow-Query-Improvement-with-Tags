<p>In specific terms of querying, I would recommend that you use the XPath.  It's technically deprecated, but seems to be widely used by the community, which means that the implementation is complete and widely used.  I suspect that it's more complete in the RMI remote stack as well.  </p>

<p>You might already know this, and the other answer alludes to this, but the rmi remoting of jackrabbit doesn't seem to be intended for real usage, as mentioned in threads like <a href="http://markmail.org/thread/knqawjttulhmj3bq" rel="nofollow">this</a> one. </p>

<p>The davex remoting seems to be the preferred way, and, while it's not completely implemented either, there seems to be enough in place to do everything you would need to do.  </p>
