<p>Alias-i has a <a href="http://alias-i.com/lingpipe/web/demos.html" rel="nofollow">natural language parser for PHP</a>. </p>

<p>Edit: <a href="http://www.akshatsinghal.com/content/natural-language-processing-php" rel="nofollow">this page</a> says Alias-i's parser is written in PHP, but Alias-i's website says it is written in Java.</p>
