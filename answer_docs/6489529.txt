<p>If two developers are working together, you can either create a new repo that they both access (on a network share or a server), or they can access each other's repos.</p>

<p>You can add another remote to your repo like this:</p>

<pre><code>git remote add frank git@fserver.com:user5/project.git
git remote add john https://user5@jserver.com/user5/project.git
</code></pre>

<p>The first requires that there's a machine called fserver.com that's running git daemon and someone named user5 has an account there. The new remote is named "frank".</p>

<p>The second requires that there's a machine called jserver.com that's hosting git via http and someone named user5 has an account there. The new remote is named "john".</p>

<p>You can then run <code>git fetch frank</code> to grab commits from frank's repo.</p>
