<p>Strictly speaking, the behaviour that you've observed is more of a bug than a feature.  It's down to the fact that Linux isn't properly multi-head.  What you're seeing is an effect of the X server switching its own, allocated, <a href="http://linuxjournal.com./article/2783" rel="nofollow" title="Linux Journal: Linux Programming Hints">virtual terminal</a> onto the console.  This of course &mdash; because only <em>one</em> virtual terminal can be active at a time <em>system-wide</em> &mdash; switches out the virtual terminal that was being displayed, even though it was being displayed on another display adapter entirely.</p>
