<p>Take your input and make sure it's a string so that it's iterable.</p>

<p>Then perform a list comprehension and change each value back to a number.</p>

<p>Now, you can do the sum of all the numbers if you want:</p>

<pre><code>inp = [int(i) for i in str(input("Enter a number:"))]
print sum(inp)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you really want to see the output while it's executing:</p>

<pre><code>def printadd(x,y):
    print x+y
    return x+y

inp = [int(i) for i in str(input("Enter a number:"))]
reduce(printadd,inp)
</code></pre>
