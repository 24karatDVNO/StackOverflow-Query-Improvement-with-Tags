<p>Do you mean on a phone or emulator.
In emulator your apps will remain installed. Just do a solo run of the emulator and then check out the menu of the phone in the emulator you will be able to find both of your apps 
and remember to uncheck the option of WIPE USER DATA when you are creating an emulator </p>
