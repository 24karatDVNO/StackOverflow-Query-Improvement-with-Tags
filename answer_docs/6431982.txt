<p>I would load the "regular" lead instance from nHibernate with its contact detail collection. Then I would use AutoMapper, to map it to the DTO class.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is a much cleaner approach since you do not create special data access methods just for "simple" DTO mappings. And it's easier for refactoring since everything is expressed via "c sharp code".</p>
