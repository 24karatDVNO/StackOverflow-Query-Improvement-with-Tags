<p>I don't know for sure what the problem is, but my guess is that I had 1 too many form fields, which caused ddl2 to not be stored correctly in the ViewState.   </p>

<p>So I created a LightDropDownList which subclassed DropDownList and used that for ddl2.   The LightDropDownList disables ViewState, and calls DataBind() during OnInit.   The way the normal DDL works is that it loads the Items from the ViewState, sets the selected item on LoadPostData, and then the Items get overridden when the Page databinds.   So I could eliminate the need to store all the Items data in the ViewState simply by manually calling DataBind.   That way when the LoadPostData method gets called, the DDL has its Items loaded and therefore the selected item is correctly set.</p>
