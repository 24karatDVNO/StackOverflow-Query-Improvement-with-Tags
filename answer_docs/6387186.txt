<p>If you don't like to use (or are not allowed) to rely on flash (which I personally would not), I think you're better off creating a text area with the text (or serialized data) preselected with an instruction for the user to copy and later paste the data. </p>

<p>You can make the instruction feel more native by sniffing for the operating system and give different instructions on how to copy and paste (e.g. ctrl+c for windows/linux or âŒ˜-C for mac).</p>

<p>Maybe not as sexy, but way more foolproof...</p>
