<p>"The count box shows how many times the URL has been Tweeted."</p>

<p>Your problem is you simply have the url and counturl mixed up. Change url to the short one, for display purposes - that's the one people will see. Use the counturl for the one with all the parameters, to ensure they go to the right place with the parameters intact.</p>

<p>I suspect the reason your count kept showing zero tweets is because you have a different (unique) url as your primary url each time it is tweeted, so each tweet is the first time that url (including its parameters) was shared.</p>
