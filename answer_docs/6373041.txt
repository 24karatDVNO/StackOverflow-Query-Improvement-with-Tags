<p>If you are just starting to learn ANT then I would suggest you learn <a href="http://www.gradle.org/" rel="nofollow">gradle</a> instead, it has the dependency part already integrated and is far easier to work with. Furthermore if you need a specific ANT task you can simply call it from gradle or even import whole ant scripts.</p>

<p>Otherwise I agree with the answer from Stefan Kendall.</p>
