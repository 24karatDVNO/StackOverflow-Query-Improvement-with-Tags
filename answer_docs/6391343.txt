<p>Is <code>yield return</code> what you're looking for?</p>

<p><code>using</code> will call Dispose() and Close() when it reaches the closing brace, but I think the question is how to achieve this particular structure of code.</p>

<p>Edit: Just realized that this isn't exactly what you're looking for, but I'll leave this answer here since a lot of people aren't aware of this technique.</p>

<pre><code>static IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; GetLines(string filename)
{
    using (var r = new StreamReader(filename))
    {
        string line;
        while ((line = r.ReadLine()) != null)
            yield return line;
    }
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine(GetLines("file.txt").Count());

    //Or, similarly: 

    int count = 0;
    foreach (var l in GetLines("file.txt"))
        count++;
    Console.WriteLine(count);
}
</code></pre>
