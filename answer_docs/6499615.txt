<p>I'm assuming that upload file is a method you're trying to invoke on the same class you defined it on. If that's the case, all you have to do is</p>

<pre><code> this.UploadFile();
</code></pre>

<p>and adjust the UploadFile() method to read the file from a member variable instead of a parameter. </p>

<p>Hope that gives you enough info to get started.</p>
