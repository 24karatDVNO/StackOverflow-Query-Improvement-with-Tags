<li><p>No. Reads don't need to be in a transaction</p></li>
<li><p>The SET is scoped only for the stored procedure. See my answer here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/788636/is-it-okay-if-from-within-one-stored-procedure-i-call-another-one-that-sets-a-low/788849#788849">Is it okay if from within one stored procedure I call another one that sets a lower transaction isolation level?</a>. However, you'd use the NOLOCK hint rather then SET: <code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myTable WITH (NOLOCK)</code>.</p></li>
