<p>You can find something in <a href="http://visualvm.java.net" rel="nofollow">VisualVM</a>. It integrates the OQL scripting engine and allows you to persist your own queries so you can easily run them against various heap dumps. However, it is not yet ready for headless analysis.</p>

<p>The OQL implementation in <strong>VisualVM</strong> is based on the one you can find in <strong>jhat</strong> and it means that it is javascript based - in addition to "standard" <strong>OQL</strong> queries it allows you to use plain javascript thus increasing the flexibility many times. </p>

<p>There are few examples of the javascript analysis bundled with VisualVM or you can use the user mailing list to get help.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
