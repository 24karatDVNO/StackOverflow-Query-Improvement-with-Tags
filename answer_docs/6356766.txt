<p>I think it can be possible by this condition in index.php 
countModules('condition')) { ?>
     do something

     do something else
</p>

<p>you can put what you want in this module and according to this condtion you have to only insert module name in countModules('your module Name') followed by bhe code in the braces. and for rest of pages you can put your code in the else part.</p>
