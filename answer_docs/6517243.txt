<p>I do not know this is an overkill but you can try SWIG, which is: a software development tool that connects programs written in C and C++ with a variety of high-level programming languages.</p>

<p>You can see from the  supportted languages here <a href="http://www.swig.org/compat.html#SupportedLanguages" rel="nofollow">http://www.swig.org/compat.html#SupportedLanguages</a>, that PHP is supported. I think this is what you are looking for.</p>
