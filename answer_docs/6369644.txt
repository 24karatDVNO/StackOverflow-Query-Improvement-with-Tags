<p>You made yourself a very tough task (and asked an interesting question, by the way).</p>

<p>The only language that springs to my mind is Ada (it has an <a href="http://www.enyo.de/fw/software/gnat-gc" rel="nofollow noreferrer">optional garbage collector</a>, as <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1691059/why-doesnt-ada-have-a-garbage-collector">discussed in this thread</a>, and according to <a href="http://www.it.bton.ac.uk/staff/je/adacraft" rel="nofollow noreferrer">this book</a> it support object-orientation). This <a href="http://shootout.alioth.debian.org" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Ubuntu comparison</a> shows that Ada 2005 is quite fast, generally faster in benchmarks than Java, but slower than C/C++.</p>

<p><em>Disclaimer</em>: I do not claim that Ada is superior to any other language. In fact, I have not used it in any reasonable application. I believe using C++ will produce faster code; moreover, probably the effort required to manage the memory manually in C++ is worth the speed improvement, but I am not an expert in this. This is not to start a flamewar (as @Doc pointed out, it may happen); just my opinion on the topic.</p>
