<p>For every Binding you define you can add a Converter. This can converter can be a single value converter, then you must implement the IValueConverter Interface.
But I think you can solve your problem with a IMultiValueConverter. This Converter can be given much values, which can also get from Bindings. The Converter is getting the values from the Bindings, processing them with your logic and then giving it back to your property where you defined it.
