<p>You can check if requested resource is not a file/directory and only then rewrite. For example:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule (.*) /seoparser.php?$1 [QSA,L]
</code></pre>

<p>Depending on circumstances (what rewrite logic you have in place/needs to be implemented) this can be much better solution than mentioned by @inti. You will see such combination of rules used in a lot of real applications (for example, WordPress, Magento) and PHP frameworks (most of the time they will have only internal routing logic).</p>

<p>This is a bit different approach (mostly from organisational point of view):</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
# Do not do anything for already existing files
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule .+ - [L]

# Your rewrite rules (file/folder does not exist, we may need to route it elsewhere)
RewriteRule (.*) /seoparser.php?$1 [QSA,L]
</code></pre>
