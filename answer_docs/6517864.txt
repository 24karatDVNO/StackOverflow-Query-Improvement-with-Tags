<p>The reason to put CSS in the top is to load it before rendering the page, so the page is rendered with it's styles. Otherwise it will be rendered without the design, and later re-rendered. The JS often is loaded at the bottom, not at the top. The reason to load some JS in the header is to have it available in the page (otherwise you may call undefined object/function, if you have JS in the page body, that uses external libraries)</p>
