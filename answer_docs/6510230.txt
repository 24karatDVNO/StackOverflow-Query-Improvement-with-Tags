<p>A PDF is a structured and compressed file format containing a number of resources, such as plain text and binary data (images, fonts, etc.). Compression is optional. The main problem with attempting to pull text strings out of the PDF is that you don't know if the text structure was maintained during conversion. Some programs do a good job maintaining words/sentences as a string, while others may break things up in a way that makes the raw text from the PDF source unreadable. The source document and PDF rendering app matter in this case.</p>
