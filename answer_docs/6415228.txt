<p>Make an array of rules.  You can store the rules as lambdas, or store their function names as symbols, or strings. whatever is easiest.
Then check each pair against the rule set.  For lambdas it would be something like:</p>

<pre><code> valid = input_pairs.map{|pair| rules.find{|rule| !rule[pair]}}
</code></pre>

<p>If you store symbols use <code>send(rule,pair)</code>.  For strings, <code>eval "#{rule}(pair)"</code></p>
