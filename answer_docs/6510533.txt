<p>Programming is best learned by doing.</p>

<p>Work with him on writing a simple address book application.  (No need to save anything, as this is a OOP learning experience.)  Make a class <code>CEntry</code> that would represent each record in the address book.  It would contain things such as the person's name, street address, city, state, zip code, and phone number.  The make another class <code>CName</code>, which would have members <code>first</code>, <code>middle,</code> and <code>last</code>.  Finally, make a third class <code>CPhone</code> which would have members for <code>country</code>, <code>area_code</code>, <code>prefix</code>, and <code>number</code>.  As he writes it, you can explain why the use of classes makes sense for this application, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of having <code>CEntry</code> inherit from <code>CName</code> and <code>CPhone</code> or contain new instances of those classes.</p>
