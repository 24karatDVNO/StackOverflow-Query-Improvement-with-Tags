<p>Most probably your program is just exiting because the code in the <code>main</code> method is finished very quickly.</p>

<p>We don't know what is your <code>Player</code> but I think it is playing music on a different thread than main thread, so as long as your code stops, it works fine.</p>

<p>In the <code>main</code> method, you should stop execution of code. For that, simply you can read something from console using:</p>

<pre><code>import java.util.Scanner;
...
// here we will get input and program won't quit until we press Return
new Scanner(System.in).readLine();
</code></pre>

<p>In addition to that, you can use something like </p>

<pre><code>try{Thread.sleep(Long.MAX_VALUE);} catch(Exception e){}
</code></pre>

<p>to sleep main thread and wait too much time.</p>
