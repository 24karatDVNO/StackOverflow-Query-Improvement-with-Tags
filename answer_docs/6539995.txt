<p>Consider the sequence:</p>

<pre>
0 NSObject *obj = [[NSObject alloc] init];
1 [obj retain]
2 [obj release]
3 [obj release]
4 NSLog("@%@",obj);
5 [obj retain]
</pre>

<p>will crash at line 4 (obj has been deallocated), while the sequence:</p>

<pre>
0 NSObject *obj = [[NSObject alloc] init];
1 [obj retain]
2 [obj retain]
3 [obj release]
4 [obj release]
4 NSLog("@%@",obj);
</pre>

<p>will leak (obj retain count is 1).</p>

<p>As you can see the same operations but in different order can change your object from being extra-deallocated to leaked.</p>
