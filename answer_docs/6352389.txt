<p>I think the best way to do this is to set an environment variable and use <code>execve()</code> to run the binary. Presumably you could just set <code>PATH</code> and then <code>execve()</code> a shell that would use PATH to find a copy of the executable. The library equivalent would be to set <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> and <code>execve()</code> a binary that has this library as a dependency.</p>

<p>In either case, you are not changing the external environment, only manufacturing a modified copy that is used with <code>execve()</code>.</p>
