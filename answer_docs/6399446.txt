<p>If you don't specify all three border attributes, then you get default values. For the width this happens to be <code>medium</code>. For the style this is <code>none</code>, which means you get no border, no matter what the width is. I'm not sure that CSS defines a name for the default colour, but Firefox uses the current text colour.</p>
