<p>Remove the <code>DISTINCT</code> first I think because it will count for each date.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT BillingLawyer, 
(SELECT COUNT( itemSent)FROM tbl_matteritem mit WHERE itemid=2 AND itemSent IS      NOT NULL AND mit.ItemSent= mi.itemSent) AS [Sent], 
(SELECT COUNT( itemReceived)FROM tbl_matteritem mitm WHERE itemid=2 AND itemReceived IS NOT NULL AND mitm.itemreceived = mi.itemreceived)AS Received
FROM tbl_matteritem mi JOIN tbl_matter m ON mi.matterid = m.matterid
GROUP BY BillingLawyer, ItemSent, itemreceived
ORDER BY 1
</code></pre>
