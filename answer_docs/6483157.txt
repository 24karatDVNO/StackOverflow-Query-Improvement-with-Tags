<p>@rjb:
After the 1000px has reached the png stops repeating- you'll only see black color but it will appear continuous since the bottom most pixel of the png is black.(of course you know this!)
So I'd suggest adding a background position fixed instead. So the gradient will seem never ending and black color will not span the rest of the page...
Ex:</p>

<pre>
body {
    background: #000 url(http://i.stack.imgur.com/PnLYK.png) repeat-x fixed;
}
</pre>
