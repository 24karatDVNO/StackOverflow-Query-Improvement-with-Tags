<p>If you're web app is working perfectly and performing well, why upgrade at all?</p>

<p>You should only upgrade if this upgrade fixes something, or adds a feature that you need. Upgrading for upgrading's sake is of no use to anybody, and can be quite dangerous sometimes as there's always the possibility of breaking something in the process.</p>
