<p>curl's  <code>-c</code> and <code>--cookie-jar</code> options will handle cookies that are created using <code>Set-Cookie</code> headers in an HTTP response.  Any cookies that are created by JavaScript on a web page will not be handled by curl (or wget, for that matter).   So if you're using the <code>-c</code> and <code>--cookie-jar</code> options and finding things aren't working, check to see whether the cookies are set by JavaScript or by HTTP headers.</p>
