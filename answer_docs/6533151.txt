<p>This won't work with plain XForms, since <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xforms-20091020/#ui-selectMany" rel="nofollow" title="XForms 1.1 specs | xforms:select">xforms:select</a> is defined to be bound to a single node. You will have to split up the selected values by postprocessing the node value, for example by reacting on the <code>onValueChange</code> event, or by transforming the resulting instance using XSLT.</p>
