<p><strong>I'm unsure whether I understand your question, if it is how do I open local files using chrome/firefox, this is your anwser:</strong></p>
<p><em>First a disclaimer, I have never done this and cannot vouch for the accuracy of my response</em></p>
<h2>IE</h2>
<p>Microsoft's security model is pretty fail so you can go right ahead and open these files</p>
<h2>FireFox</h2>
<p>Some quick googling found that Firefox can do this after either editing prefs.js as outlined <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Support/SID-01142" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> or installing an addon called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/locallink/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">LocalLink</a></p>
<h2>Chrome</h2>
<p>Practically impossible due to its security, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2087894/can-google-chrome-open-local-links">until now</a> when locallink was ported to chrome.</p>
