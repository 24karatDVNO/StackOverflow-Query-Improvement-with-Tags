<blockquote>
  <p>that class is also an interface</p>

<p>I wouldn't express it that way (mainly because a class <strong>is not</strong> an interface). I'd express it like that:</p>

<ul>
<li>.. that class provides the API of the interface ..</li>
<li>.. that class provides the behavior defined by the interface</li>
<li>.. that class implements the interface ..</li>
</ul>
