What do I do?</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Since Grails 0.6, Grails automatically re-compiles Java sources and
  domain classes using pre-compilation and then a server restart. This
  can lead to permgen space running out if the server is run for a long
  time and many changes are made. You can disable this feature if it is
  not important to you with:</p>
  
  <p>grails -Ddisable.auto.recompile=true run-app</p>
  
  <p>There is also a problem with Grails 0.6 on Windows where you get
  OutOfMemoryErrors during a period of activity in development mode due
  to the re-compilation. This may be solved in SVN head, but if you see
  this problem the above option can also help.</p>

<p>Easiest just to restart your application server when it happens.</p>
