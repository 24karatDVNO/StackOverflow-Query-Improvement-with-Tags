<p>There doesn't seem to be any as of yet. One way you can implement this is to have your app on the device. Send messages to it using <a href="http://techtej.blogspot.com/2010/10/android-c2dm-messaging-server-push-for.html" rel="nofollow">C2DM</a>. The app configures WiFi and may be do more.</p>

<p>However, if you are looking for a ready-made solution, I'm not aware of any that exists - and if it does exist, it will certainly require an app on the device. There is currently no way to configure any settings on the Android without your own app.</p>
