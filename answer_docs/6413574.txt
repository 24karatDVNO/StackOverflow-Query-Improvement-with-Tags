<p>Does the data need to be date-specific and stored in the table? An SQL option that can be used in your source query would be to create a table with 24 records - one for each hour - then do a left join from the hours table to your table. For example:</p>

<p>Table zsysHours
Field HourValue
Data: 0, 1, 2...23</p>

<pre><code>SELECT zsysHours.HourValue, HourlyData.Value FROM zsysHours 
LEFT JOIN HourlyData ON zsysHours.HourValue=HourlyData.HourValue
</code></pre>

<p>This can be done with date/time values as well, just makes it more complicated.</p>
