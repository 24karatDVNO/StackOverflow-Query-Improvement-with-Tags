<p>If you request this URL <code>domain.com/services</code> it will be redirected to <code>domain.com/services/</code> if such file/folder does not exist. Then, if  (ONLY IF) <code>domain.com/services.php</code> is does exist, it will be rewritten to <code>domain.com/services.php</code>. If there is no such php file, then you should see 404 error.</p>

<p>In theory you could add these lines after "force canonical name" rule, then you can get rid of few RewriteCond rules later (useful if you have quite a bit rewrite rules), but you have to verify this on your site -- it works fine for me, but you may have specific circumstances:</p>

<pre><code># Do not do anything for already existing files
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule .+ - [L]
</code></pre>
