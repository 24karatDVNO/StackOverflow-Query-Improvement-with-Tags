<p>Quick attempt, which gets the results you've posted in your question (except the 1st 3 rows are not NULL). Assumes that VALUE field is unique and in ascending order:</p>

<pre><code>-- Create test TABLE with 38 values in
DECLARE @T TABLE (Value INTEGER)
DECLARE @Counter INTEGER
SET @Counter = 1
WHILE (@Counter &lt;= 38)
    BEGIN
        INSERT @T VALUES(@Counter)
        SET @Counter = @Counter + 1
    END

-- This gives the results   
SELECT t1.VALUE, x.Val
FROM @T t1
    OUTER APPLY(SELECT SUM(VALUE) FROM (SELECT TOP 4 VALUE FROM @T t2 WHERE t2.VALUE &lt;= t1.VALUE ORDER BY t2.VALUE DESC) x) AS x(Val)
ORDER BY VALUE
</code></pre>

<p>At the very least, you should see the kind of direction I was heading in.</p>
