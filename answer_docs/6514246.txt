<p>I can't be sure without more testing, but I'm betting your events aren't bubbling the way you'd expect. You're adding/removing the class while you're still hovering/animating, so the process fires a few times. </p>

<p>I would suggest rewriting the function to trigger off of mouseenter/mouseleave events, I think this would help you making sure the events only fire once. You may not even have to add/remove classes with this method..</p>

<pre><code>$(".slide_box").live('mouseenter', function () {
    //animate up
})

$(".slide_box").live('mouseleave', function () {
    //animate down
})
</code></pre>
