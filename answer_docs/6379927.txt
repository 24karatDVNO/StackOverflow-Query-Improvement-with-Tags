<p>The simplest thing I can think of would be to redirect the user to the script with the new GET variable.</p>

<pre><code>if( $_GET['abc'] == 1 ) {
    header( 'Location: '.$_SERVER['PHP_SELF'].'?abc=2' );
}
</code></pre>

<p>If you would like to do this without exiting the running PHP script, take a look at <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php" rel="nofollow">cURL</a>.</p>
