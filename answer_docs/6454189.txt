<p>On the latter, you would need to develop your own shipping module for this, perhaps forked off of one of the existing shipping modules. It's actually one of the more documented projects you can undertake in Magento. For instance, take a look at <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com/wiki/5_-_modules_and_development/shipping/create-shipping-method-module" rel="nofollow">the Magento site's tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Thanks,
