<p>In order to open the local queue, the application must have first connected to the queue manager successfully.  The error on the remote queue is a connection error so it is not even getting to the queue manager.  This suggests that you are using different connection factories and that the second one has some differences in the connectivity parameters.  First step is to reconcile those differences.</p>

<p>Also, a MQJMS2013 Security Error can be many things, most of which are not actually MQ issues.  For example some people store their managed objects in LDAP and an authentication problem there will throw this error.  For people who use a filesystem-based JNDI, OS file permissions can cause the same thing.  However if it is an actual WMQ issue (which this appears to be) then the linked exception will contain the MQ Reason Code (for example, MQRC=2035).  If you want to be able to better diagnose MQ (or for that matter any JMS transport) issues, it pays to get in the habit of printing linked exceptions.</p>

<p>If you are not able to resolve this issue based on this input, I would advise updating the question with details of the managed object definitions and the reason code obtained from printing the linked exceptions.</p>
