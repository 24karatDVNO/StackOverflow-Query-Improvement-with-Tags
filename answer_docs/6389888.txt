<p>They key to getting something to show up in the GUI designer is that it will be there when the Form's default constructor is called.  If you can access the image as a resource (as others have suggested) then it will be available in the build/classes hierarchy that Netbeans uses when trying to run your class to make the Form preview in the designer.  Get this image loaded inside the default, no-argument constructor of the Form, and it should show up in the designer.</p>
