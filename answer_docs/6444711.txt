<p>It's much faster to use a large buffer, because the drive will then be able to read eg. an entire cylinder at once, instead of reading a sector, then waiting for the next request to read another. Also, there's a lot of overhead involved in each request, like getting access to the bus and setting the dma controller.
Just take to don't use so much memory that you'll need to swap data out to the disk, which will slow things down a lot.</p>
