<p>I don't understand why you don't have two separate graphs on the same page. As each graph is an image, just have two  elements on the page, each of which calls a CGI program to generate one image.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="/path/to/generate/first_graph.cgi?param1=something;param2=something_else/"&gt;
&lt;img src="/path/to/generate/second_graph.cgi?param1=something;param2=something_else/"&gt;
</code></pre>
