<p>Using Regex with C# or VBScript is pretty much the same because it all comes to developing the regular expression. Something like this could help:
<code>&lt;Reference\s+Include\s*=\s*\".+\",\s*Version\s*=\s*.+,</code></p>

<p>Not sure what are the rules about case sensitivity and white spaces in csproj files, but this covers the form you described previously. Note that the "+" operator means one or kleen.</p>
