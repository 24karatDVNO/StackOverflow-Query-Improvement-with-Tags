<p>I was involved in creating MOVEit Freely.  It never had support for SFTP over SSH - it only had support for FTP/S.  Its original role was to be a "drop-in" command-for-command replacement of Microsoft's FTP.exe client - with extra support for SSL/TLS.  </p>

<p>MOVEit Freely was originally built on top of a Dundas FTP/S stack, but we heavily modifed the original source code as FTP/S evolved.  (We got in a bit early.)   These days Dundas is focused on Dashboard components and the license agreement we signed with Dundas said that we'd never publish a standalone FTP/S component based on their code.  (That's standard for that kind of OEM license.)  In other words, I'd check out one of the Windows-based recommendations above.  (I recommend components from \n software, and also like the Rebex offering on Windows.)  </p>
