<p>You can either use drharris' solution which seems more general and "clearer" or you can use anonymous delegates:</p>

<pre><code>MyComClass cl = new MyComClass();

cl.MyEvent += new MyComClassDelegate(delegate(MyEventArgs args){ RealHandler(cl, args);})
</code></pre>

<p>Now your RealHandler will receive the original arguments and the object that raised the event.</p>

<p>This is not something one wants to type a lot but it might be an alternative if you only have a few places where you create the classes and add the event handlers.</p>
