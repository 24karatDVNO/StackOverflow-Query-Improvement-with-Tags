<p><code>onCleanup</code> functions still fire in the presence of CTRL-C, however I don't think that's really going to help because it will be hard for you to connect the value you want to the <code>onCleanup</code> function handle (there are some tricky variable lifetime issues here). You may have more luck using a MATLAB handle object to track your value. For example</p>

<pre><code>x = containers.Map(); x('Value') = [];
myFcn(x); % updates x('Value') 
% CTRL-C
x('Value') % contains latest value
</code></pre>
