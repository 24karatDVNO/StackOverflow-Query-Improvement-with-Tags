<p>I was involved in creating MOVEit Freely.  You may also want to try just running the client like this:</p>

<p>...to dump the short help.  But "JW" is right.  The "-z          to not warn about problems with certificates" option was what we created to avoid this exact situation.  As long as the certificate isn't expired (I don't think we let that one go), the "-z" argument will eat all other errors.  </p>
