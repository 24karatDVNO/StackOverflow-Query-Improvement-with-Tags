<p>I'm not sure if it'll look good, but as 9-patch actually allows you to set multiple stretchable areas, you could try to set multiple vertical areas of 1 pixel high, and have all those stretch (basically, have a stretchable line every 2 pixels). This won't look as good as if the gradient worked perfectly, but might be good enough if you don't stretch it too much.</p>
