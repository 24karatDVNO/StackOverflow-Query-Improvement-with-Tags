<p>It's hard to tell for sure because you don't have the <code>live</code> calls in context but I assume that the calls to <code>live</code> are within some code that is called multiple times.  If so, this is the problem.  <code>live</code> should only be called once for each element.  <code>live</code> will then automatically apply to all items created matching the selector.  If it is called multiple times you will attach another handler each time.</p>
