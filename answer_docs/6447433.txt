<p>I don't think that there is the one and only place to find resources. Good websites are for example:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/" rel="nofollow">Great thoughts about simple and
clean user interfaces out of an
information architect's point of
view.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" rel="nofollow">Many articles about web design,
frontend-development, user
interfaces, etc.</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.usabilitypost.com/" rel="nofollow">Some great articles about usability
and related topics.</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://www.infosthetics.com/" rel="nofollow">Visual inspiration</a></li>
</ul>

<p>… the list might be endless. Just google for some terms like "information architecture", "ixd", "ui/ux design", "usability", etc. — hope this helps you.</p>
