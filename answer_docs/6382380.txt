<p>Try the below - note that you appeared to be attempting to join the two tables to perform the 'not in' which would result in a very slow to produce and very wrong resultset.</p>

<p>Also, if IDDate is a DATETIME column then you'd be better of performing a range check e.g.  <code>(a.IDDate &gt;= '2011-04-21' AND a.IDDate &lt; '2011-04-22')</code>.  Thinking about it - if it's a text column in the format yyyy-MM-dd then a range check would also work - if it's a text column with mixed format dates then forget I mentioned it.</p>

<pre><code>select x.Station as Station,
       count(distinct x.NimID) as Difference
from (
      select a.NimID,
             a.IDDate,
             a.Station
      from database1.dbo.table1 a
      where left(cast(a.IDDate as date),11)='2011-04-21'
 ) as X
 where x.NimID not in (
      select b.XilID
      from database2.dbo.Table2 b
      where b.XilDate='2011-04-21'
 )
 group by x.Station
</code></pre>
