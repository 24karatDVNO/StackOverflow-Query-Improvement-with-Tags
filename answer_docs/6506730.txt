<p>Rather than using CSS/Javascript to change the background of the checkbox, which will have issues cross-browser (as @Town has pointed out) I would recommend using the ASP.NET Ajax Control Toolkit's "Toggle Button" control. Then use an image of a checked checkbox (print screen or designed if you wish), and the same image unchecked.</p>

<p>This control uses the CheckBox control so you would have all the usual functionalities of an ASP.NET CheckBox too</p>
