<p>See if you can create some sort of "global coordinate system" using the size and position of the JPanels. Take a look at this part of the JComponent doc: <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#getX%28%29" rel="nofollow">http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/JComponent.html#getX%28%29</a>. With that, you should be able to find the positions and sizes of the panels relative to eachother. The code from your paint() function would help too.</p>
