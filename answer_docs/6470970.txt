<p>Will here again: LayoutTransform was a much, much simpler solution to this.  I put the main image and the label into a stackpanel. Then I applied the scale transform to the image as a LayoutTransform rather than a RenderTransform, and applied the Translate and Rotate transforms to the stackpanel. Problem solved :-)</p>
