<p>To me, second query is more efficient because it lowers the number of records for GROUP BY and HAVING.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you may try the following query to avoid using IN:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT `fp`.`user_id`
FROM `forum_posts` `fp`
LEFT JOIN `banned_users` `bu` ON `fp`.`user_id` = `bu`.`user_id`
WHERE `bu`.`user_id` IS NULL
GROUP BY `fp`.`user_id`
HAVING COUNT(`fp`.`id`) &gt;= 100
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
