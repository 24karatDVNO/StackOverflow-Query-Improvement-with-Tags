<p>I used an different approach to the same problem: Each module has it's own interfaces, correct? In this case, by interface you mean an programatic interface, like a EJB interface (in java), or a .h file (in old plain C), etc... But if you have a single database (even if the each module own a group of tables, you may have all of it a single database ) you can expose some part of your interface as a view in DB. In this case, each module will define a set of programatic interfaces, and a set of "DB interfaces", only for query purposes. You will be able to read data for your report using simple SQL and joins and only access what a module wants to expose. </p>
