<p>Depending on what settings your host has allowed you may be able to use <a href="http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.set-time-limit.php" rel="nofollow">set_time_limit()</a> pass to it in seconds how long you want it to spend before it times out (use 0 for infinite). E.g:</p>

<pre><code>set_time_limit(0);     //script will now run till completes
</code></pre>

<p>GoDaddy may have blocked this though so if it doesn't work try contacting them</p>
