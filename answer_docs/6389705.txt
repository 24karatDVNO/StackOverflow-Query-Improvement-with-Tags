<p>I'm not sure that kind of terminology really applies to an OO language like Java. There's a distinction made between primitives, which can only contain a single value, and Objects, however an Object might contain any number of other objects.</p>

<p>Objects whose purpose is to contain zero-or-more instances of some other object are (in my experience) referred to as collections, maybe because of the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html" rel="nofollow">Collections API</a> or <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html" rel="nofollow">Arrays</a>.</p>

<p>I guess languages where you're dealing explicitly with pointers and the like depend on the distinction more.</p>
