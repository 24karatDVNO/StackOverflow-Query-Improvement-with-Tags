<p>I would suggest, if you aren't going to preload the names all into the client side then you would be better doing the search after the first character is input. This will reduce the number of names you need to search for to a fraction and then submit that request to the DB. You can then return those results in alphabetical order, once as more characters are typed you can filter without sorting. Every request should then meet your 150ms target as long as a user doesn't have thousands of friends called "David Smith".</p>
