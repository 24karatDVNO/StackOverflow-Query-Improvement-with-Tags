<p>My best guess/answer so far:</p>

<p>It appears to have something to do with the way I'm "nesting" the return (returning the list function). </p>

<p>If I duplicate the List() method call inside my UpdateStatus and use the following line:</p>

<pre><code>Return View("List",plvm)
</code></pre>

<p>It works, sort of.  </p>

<p>Sometimes it doesn't return any data, just blanks out the entire list and leaves it there and I have to reload the entire page.  Is that a bug in the ajax implementation?</p>
