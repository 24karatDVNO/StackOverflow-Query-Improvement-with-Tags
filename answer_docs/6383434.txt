<li><p>You need a loop to read the file line by line, I'd suggest a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/BufferedReader.html" rel="nofollow"><code>BufferedReader</code></a> for this.</p></li>
<li><p>Inside the loop you are checking for sequences of lines that start and end with 'Contact'. Each of these will be an XML <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/lang/model/element/Element.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Element</code></a>. Within those sequences you can create XML <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/lang/model/element/Element.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Element</code></a>s for each of the data items, i.e. Firstname, Secondname, Email, URL.</p></li>
<li><p>You can check to see if a line is an email address by trying to create an <a href="http://javamail.kenai.com/nonav/javadocs/javax/mail/internet/InternetAddress.html" rel="nofollow"><code>InternetAddress</code></a> using it. You can check to see if a line is a URL by trying to create a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/URL.html" rel="nofollow"><code>URL</code></a> from it.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two strategies for writing the XML output. The easiest would be to build the whole XML document in memory and then write it to file once the input file has been fully read. If your input file is very large this might not be practical and you might need to write each contact <code>Element</code> to an output stream before starting on the next.</p></li>
