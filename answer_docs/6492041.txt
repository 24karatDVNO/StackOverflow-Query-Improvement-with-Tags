<p>This is very much possible.</p>

<p>Using CSS, say position: absolute for the image and the form's div.</p>

<p>Then using z-index, make sure that the image lies over the form.</p>

<p>Then you can use the HTML onmouseover event to execute something like a call to Adobe Spry's slide animation effect to neatly accomplish what you're trying to do.</p>

<p>But in my honest opinion, this is unnecessary glitter.</p>
