<pre><code>select sum(select top 4 Value from [table] order by Value Desc)
</code></pre>

<p>or, perhaps</p>

<pre><code>select sum(value)
from [Table]
where Value &gt;= (Max(Value) - 4)
</code></pre>

<p>I haven't actually tried either of those- and can't at the moment, but they should get you pretty close.</p>
