<p>I believe the easiest way to deal with this problem (and, as far as I can tell, the base Android source does the same thing) is to just generate a high definition image and put it in the HDPI folder, then let Android handle the downsampling for you. You only need to provide lower resolution images when the downsampled image would not have sufficient contrast, or just look wrong. I might be wrong, but I have yet to find a screen combo that doesn't look right, at least image wise. Layouts, well, that's something else.</p>
