<p>You can write a C function like this:</p>

<pre><code>void switchtheviews(UIViewController *coming, UIViewController *going)
{
...
/* there is no self here */
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>And use it anywhere in your code:</p>

<p><code>switchtheviews(v1, v2);</code></p>

<p>I don't think this is what you want. You can write a private method to do the same thing and keep everything encapsulated in your class. Try something like this on your <code>.m</code> file (it's private stuff, no need to put it on the <code>.h</code>):</p>

<pre><code>// MegaCoolViewController.m

@interface MegaCoolViewController ()

- (void)_switchtheviews:(UIViewController*)coming over:(UIViewController*)going;

@end


@implementation MegaCoolViewController

#pragma mark - Private

- (void)_switchtheviews:(UIViewController*)coming over:(UIViewController*)going
{
/* do your thing, use self freely */
}

@end
</code></pre>

<p>As you can read in other answers, there are easier ways to switch views. I'm just answering the syntax part of the question.</p>
