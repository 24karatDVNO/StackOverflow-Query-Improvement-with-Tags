<p>In general I believe "PascalCase" is used to denote static fields, and "camelCase" is used for instance fields. Also, as a general rule of thumb all method arguments should probably be "camelCase" or just "lower" if possible (I think a short truncation for a method argument is fine due to the limited scope).</p>

<p>However, I don't think having your method parameter arguments match exactly to instance field names is ideal in any situation. As far as prefixes go, any Hungarian notation should probably be avoided.</p>
