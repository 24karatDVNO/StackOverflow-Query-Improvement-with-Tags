<p>Instead of UIImageView you can take custom UIButton and assign same image to button and you will get touchupInside event of that button. Just assign button.tag = indexpath.row so you can get which cell's Button pressed. </p>

<pre><code>-(IBAction)ButtonPressed:(id)sender{
     UIButton *btnSelected = sender;
     switch(btnSelected.tag){
       case: 0
       ///Cell 0's Button Pressed. 
       break;
       ......
       ......
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this help.</p>
