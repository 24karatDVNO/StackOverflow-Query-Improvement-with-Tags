<p><a href="http://wwwold.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n869/n869.pdf.gz" rel="nofollow"><b>C99</b></a> has this to say about initialization in Section 6.7.8, subclause 10:</p>

<p>If an object that has automatic storage duration is not initialized explicitly, its value is
indeterminate. If an object that has static storage duration is not initialized explicitly,
then:</p>

<p>if it has pointer type, it is
   initialized to a null pointer; </p>

<p>if
   it has arithmetic type, it is
   initialized to (positive or unsigned)
   zero;</p>

<p>if it is an aggregate, every
   member is initialized (recursively)
   according to these rules;</p>

<p>if it is
   a union, the first named member is
   initialized (recursively) according
   to these rules.</p>
