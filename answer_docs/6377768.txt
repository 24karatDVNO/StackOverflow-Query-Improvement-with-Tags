<p>Sounds fine; you're turning basic ETL into ETVL, adding a "validate" step. Normally this is considered part of the "transform" stage, but I prefer to keep that stage purer when I conceptualize an architecture like this; transform is turning the raw fields which were pulled out and chopped up in the extract stage into objects of my domain model. Verifying that those objects are in a valid state for the system is validation.</p>
