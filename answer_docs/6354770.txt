<p>There's no sensible way to answer that. A primary key is a logical feature of a database whereas performance is determined by the physical implementation and what operations you want to perform on it. You might as well ask "Will a red car go faster than a blue one?"</p>

<p>Two different key constraints on different data types are in any case not functionally equivalent. So even given the necessary context it would be an odd and probably not very useful comparison to make.</p>
