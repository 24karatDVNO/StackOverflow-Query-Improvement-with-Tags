<p>If the velocity must be integral, just update the values to the floor of the floating-point calculation.  So to reduce velocity by 10%:</p>

<pre><code>m_velocityX = floor(m_velocityX * 0.9);
</code></pre>

<p>You might want to do something fancier someday, but this seems simple and workable.</p>
