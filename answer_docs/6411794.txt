<p>It has detected that the version on disk has changed since it was put in the cache, and you need to refresh the workspace to update the cached version.</p>

<p>This typically happen when you fiddle with files outside of Eclipse.  If the process doing the fiddling is invoked from within Eclipse you can tell Eclipse to refresh the workspace when the process is finished.</p>
