<p>It's your idTabs plugin causing the problem, taking that out writes out the console.log.</p>

<p>I tried using the beta version from the dev's website but that continued to stop the rest working.</p>

<p>I would be tempted to write your own jQuery to do what you want, it will only be a few lines compared to a big plugin, and you can be sure it won't mess up anything else.</p>
