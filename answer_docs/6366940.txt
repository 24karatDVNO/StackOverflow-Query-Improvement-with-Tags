<p>Look, if you are trying to make a button in a c++ ms-dos window, it can't be done unless you have a library that I don't about. But I found a way around that (which is long but gets the job done). What I did was I found the top left position of a button drawn out with simple cout&lt;&lt;"whatevergoeshere";, and the bottom right. Then, by creating a function that returns true when the left button is pressed and if the click is within the arguments provided for the top left corner and bottom right corner, control will move on. It is a pretty complicated process, but I can give you the source code I used in another answer.</p>

<p>(If you wan't me to explain any of this code, I will. I didn't know how to do this either until recently. One thing that is important though is keeping the window in the same place everytime. In the environment I'm using (code::blocks), the window stays in the same place, but moving it can mess up the button. Also remember to continuosly use the     system("cls"); to clear the screen so stuff doesn't change position. (system"cls" is located in the cstdio or cstdlib libraries.)</p>
