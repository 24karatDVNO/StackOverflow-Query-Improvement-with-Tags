<p>In MDX you could create two calcs - this and last week (of course you'll need to change this to work with your cube):</p>

<pre><code>WITH
MEMBER [Measures].[thisWeekCount] AS
    ([Date].[Week].[this], [Measures].[Count])
MEMBER [Measures].[lastWeekCount] AS
    ([Date].[Week].[last], [Measures].[Count])
SELECT
{
    [Measures].[thisWeekCount],
    [Measures].[lastWeekCount]
} ON 0,
{
    ...
} ON 1
FROM [Your Cube]
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can use them within placeholders as jimconstable explained, but without the <strong>iif</strong> functions.</p>
