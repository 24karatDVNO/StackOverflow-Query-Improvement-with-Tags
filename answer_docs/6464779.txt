<p>I got the solution to this, it is due to the Isolation level in Mysql, all i had to do was</p>

<pre><code>Set the default transaction isolation level transaction-isolation = READ-COMMITTED
</code></pre>

<p>And i am using Django for this i had to add this in the django database settings  </p>

<pre><code>'OPTIONS': {
                "init_command": "SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED"
                }
</code></pre>
