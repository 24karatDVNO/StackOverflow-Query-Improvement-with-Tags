<p>I'm on ubuntu 11.04, the only way I can get adb to connect to my Atrix is by changing the USB connection mode to "Windows Media Sync". Which is odd in the first place, but it's especially odd because ADB on windows won't connect when it's set to win media sync.
Or you can use wireless adb. There's a couple widgets that make it really easy to enable wifi adb. They show the ip address on the widget and everything. :) </p>
