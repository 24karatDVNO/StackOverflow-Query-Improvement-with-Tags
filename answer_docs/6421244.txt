<p>You need to have some kind of flag. 
So while handling the first click event, you set the flag to say 'true' and call a method accordingly 
and then while handling the click event when the flag is already 'false' i.e. you detect a second click; so call another method accordingly.</p>

<p>You don't need to have multiple clickEventListener for this purpose.</p>
