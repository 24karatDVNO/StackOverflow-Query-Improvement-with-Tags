<p>You need to use the Advanced Editor to tell the excel source the column is a Unicode String, not a numeric.  That is why alphanumeric fields are null.</p>

<ol>
<li>Right-click on the Excel Source and choose advanced editor</li>
<li>Choose the fourth tab "Input and Output Properties"</li>
<li>Choose the column in question under the "Output Columns" and change the source to Unicode</li>
</ol>

<p>That should fix your problem.</p>
