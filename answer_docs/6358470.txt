<p>I guess it's no comfort, but not really if the original <code>this</code> is the only context in which you can execute functions like <code>startTimer</code> and <code>killCountdown</code>. What I'd recommend is giving it a more meaningful name, like <code>timer</code> or something. Really, <code>this</code> is just a convenient keyword for referring to the owner of whatever we're executing, and it <em>should</em> change as the owner changes. If "this/that" is becoming hard to read, the solution is to change the name from <code>that</code> to something more semantically meaningful.</p>
