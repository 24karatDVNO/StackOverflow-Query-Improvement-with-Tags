<p>If your application is cross-platform, I would recommend using <a href="http://www.opentk.com" rel="nofollow">OpenTK</a>, which is a managed wrapper for OpenGL, and is often easier to learn than DirectX (either managed or native). OpenTK/OpenGL tend to deliver better performance than DirectX as well. With OpenTK, you can draw your image entirely on the GPU, then rasterize it into a bitmap which can interop with the Bitmap class in System.Drawing.</p>
