<p>I would recommend the <a href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">Pmw</a> toolkit which provides a lot of handy extras to Tkinter.  The Pmw <a href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/doc/EntryField.html" rel="nofollow">EntryField</a> class allows you to write an arbitrary validator for any text field.  Pmw is lightweight and very usable, if you are developing anything in Tkinter you will probably find its features useful.</p>
