<p>The <a href="http://jupload.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">JUpload project</a> on Sourceforge has a handy open source implementation of what you're looking for. Here's a <a href="http://jupload.sourceforge.net/applet-basic.html" rel="nofollow">demo</a>.</p>

<p>But IMO this is a UI nightmare compared to file-only js / flash based uploaders... applets are far too slow and clunky to find a place in modern websites.</p>

<p>And that approval box to allow access to the user's system is not going to inspire any trust in your application, notwithstanding the security concerns. As far as the average joe is concerned, if they're able to upload a few files without hassle, why should they have to face a strange dialog box for a folder?</p>
