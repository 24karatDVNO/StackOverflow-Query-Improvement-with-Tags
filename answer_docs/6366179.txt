<p>A good place to start would be to use a tool like <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a> in Mozilla Firefox that will allow you to watch the requests being sent to the server and look for bottlenecks.</p>

<p>Firebug will break down each part of the request, so you can see if you are having trouble talking to the server or if it is simply taking a long time to come up with a response.</p>
