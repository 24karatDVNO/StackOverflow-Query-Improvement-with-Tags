<p>It might help to understand how C <code>char*</code> "strings" work:</p>

<p>You start reading them from the char that the char* points to until you hit a <code>\0</code> char (or simply 0).</p>

<p>So if I have</p>

<pre><code>char* str = "theFile.nam";
</code></pre>

<p>then <code>str+3</code> represents the string <code>File.nam</code>.</p>

<p>But you want to remove the last three characters, so you want something like:</p>

<pre><code>char str2[9];
strncpy (str2,str,8); // now str2 contains "theFile.#" where # is some character you don't know about
str2[8]='\0'; // now str2 contains "theFile.\0" and is a proper char* string.
</code></pre>
