<p>Another solution is to generate a unique JavaScript variable on the server side (for example, a GUID) and write it to the page through perhaps a registered script. Next, on each page load you will check to see if a cookie exist with that same variable set, if one does, you can be assured that you are viewing a cached page and you should force a reload. Otherwise, store the variable to the same cookie for the next load.</p>
