<p>First hit on google: <a href="http://demo.swfupload.org/v250beta3/resizedemo/index.php" rel="nofollow">SWFUpload Resize Image on the client demo</a>. </p>

<p>Quote from the demo page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This demo shows how SWFUpload can
  resize images on the client side.
  Images resized before being uploaded
  to the server. Then some JavaScript is
  used to download the thumbnail and
  display the resized image without
  reloading the page.</p>
