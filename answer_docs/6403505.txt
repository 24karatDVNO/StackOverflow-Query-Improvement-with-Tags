<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.datetime.aspx" rel="nofollow">DateTime</a> structure documentation in MSDN.</p>

<p>In particular, you can take a look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>TryParse and TryParseExact</li>
<li>The comparison operators</li>
<li>MinValue and MaxValue</li>
</ul>

<p>You can also put try..catch (ArgumentOutOfRangeException) around the DateTime values you are trying to use.  </p>

<p>However, if you are consistently (or ever?) running into this kind of exception, I'd take a closer look at your design.  Unless you are doing some serious date-crunching, I don't know of any instance where I would be bumping into the min and max values.</p>
