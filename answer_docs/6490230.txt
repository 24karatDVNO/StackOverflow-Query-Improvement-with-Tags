<p>The only solution I know of is to create a separate C++ file, which includes all of the files you want to compile, and compile that.  A pretty bad solution, in my mind; generally, you want to increase the granularity of the object files, not reduce it.</p>

<p>The real question, I suppose, is what are you trying to achieve.  Why do you want only a single object file?</p>
