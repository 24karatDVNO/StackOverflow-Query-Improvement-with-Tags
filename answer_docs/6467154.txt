<p>If the method x is only dealing with integers not any other types of objects then you can change the method to </p>

<p><code>public void x(int x){
//do something and then create the object as needed.
}</code></p>

<p>But in your case the method is about to take any kind of object so there is no other way other than creating a new integer object.</p>
