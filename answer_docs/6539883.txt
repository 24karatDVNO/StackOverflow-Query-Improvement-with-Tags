<p>What if you union the select with a hard coded select with one value for each age group.</p>

<pre><code>select 1 as Guitar, 1 as Piano, 1 as Drums, 1 as Other
</code></pre>

<p>When you do the transform, each row will have a result that is +1 of the result you want.</p>

<pre><code>foo      barTmpCount
-------- ------------
Guitar   2
Piano    1
Drums    3
Other    1
</code></pre>

<p>You can then do a </p>

<pre><code>select foo, barTmpCount - 1 as barCount from &lt;query&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and get something like this</p>

<pre><code>foo      barCount
-------- ---------
Guitar   1
Piano    0
Drums    2
Other    0
</code></pre>
