<p>I upgraded the ASP.NET Ajax Control Toolkit to the <a href="http://ajaxcontroltoolkit.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">newest available version</a>. It now functions.</p>

<p>But, I think that the behavior seems to be slightly different than before. I added the text <em>"Tip: Type '.' to switch"</em> as instruction. I expect that users will still have trouble using this.</p>

<p>See the issues at the <a href="http://www.asp.net/ajax/ajaxcontroltoolkit/Samples/MaskedEdit/MaskedEdit.aspx" rel="nofollow">Ajax Control Toolkit sample site</a>.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/plugin-tags/money" rel="nofollow">jQuery money plugins</a> available. Any of those might provide a more usable solution.</p>
