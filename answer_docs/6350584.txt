<p>Having clarified that you've got two Access databases you need to compare, the easiest is to link the two together and then compare with a query.</p>

<p>Right-click the white empty space, <code>Link tables</code>.<br>
Locate you second DB, select the table in it.</p>

<p>Now you can write a query to compare the two. The data being compared is always up to date as it's being pulled through the link.</p>
