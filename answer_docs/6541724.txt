<p>We ran into the same problem today, and it turned out that rubygems had installed the Windows dll instead of an ELF *.so.  We are running a fairly old version of Rubygems (1.3.7), but reinstalling the gem somehow solved the problem.  Not sure if platform detection in that version of Rubygems or something?</p>
