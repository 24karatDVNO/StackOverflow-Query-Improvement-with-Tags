<p>I've added comments to your code that show my thoughts:</p>

<pre><code>private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    // Make a new list of result class objects, local to the Form1_Load method:
    List&lt;Result&gt; result = new List&lt;Result&gt;();

    // Call a method that populates a list... wait, what list?
    PopulateResult();

    dgresult.AutoGenerateColumns = false;
    dgresult.Items.Clear();

    // Set the datagrid data source to the list created earlier
    dgresult.ItemsSource = result;
    // ...
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure why the datagrid has a duplicate set of columns after you've specified and added only two columns. It would help to see the method <code>PopulateResult()</code>.</p>

<p>The list that <code>PopulateResult()</code> is adding to must be some other list, because the one created in <code>Form1_Load</code> is local in scope.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if this is just a little oversight, or if you need to learn about variable scope. Forgive me if this is already known to you:</p>
