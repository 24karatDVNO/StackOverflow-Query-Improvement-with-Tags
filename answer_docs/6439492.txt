<p>Just use ToList():</p>

<pre><code>Person Paul = TravelTicket.Members.ToList()[3];
</code></pre>

<p>EF isn't going to query data until you actually try to access it - and a collection doesn't try until you iterate it, while ToList must instantiate each instance.</p>

<p>Even better, be more specific:</p>

<pre><code>Person Paul = TravelTicket.Members.Where(m=&gt;m.Id == 3);  // or some such similar filter
</code></pre>

<p>Then you only instance ONE Member - the one you want.  </p>

<p>Note you may need Members.AsQueryable().Where instead - I never remember...</p>
