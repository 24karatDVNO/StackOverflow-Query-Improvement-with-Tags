<p>System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherPriority.<strong>ApplicationIdle</strong> means Operations are processed when the application is idle.</p>

<p>What if the application is always busy and never idle? The requests will be queued and the app slows down.</p>

<p>However I haven't tested this because I don't have the source code of your app.</p>
