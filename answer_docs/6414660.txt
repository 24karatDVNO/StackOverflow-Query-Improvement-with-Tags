<p>Despite the name similarities, IObservable and ObservableCollection are completely unrelated and unfortunately also incompatible. They have two very different models of observing a collection.</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="http://bindablelinq.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Bindable LINQ</a>. It attempts to define LINQ-to-ObservableCollection, such that a LINQ query on a ObservableCollection results in a ObservableCollection again. The project seems dead, though, and I haven't used the recommend replacement yet (<a href="http://obtics.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Obtics</a>).</p>
