<p>I would recommend for this using the standard Windows <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd743834%28v=VS.85%29.aspx1" rel="nofollow">Waveform API</a>. In Delphi you can do this with the <code>mmsystem</code> unit, you will have to verify if this unit is available in Lazarus.
There is a sample project for sound capturing using these functions <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/winsdk/SoundRecord.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It was done in C++, but the basic ideas should be the same.</p>
