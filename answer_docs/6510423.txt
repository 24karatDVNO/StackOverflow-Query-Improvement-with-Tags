<p>Thanks @Fran√ßois, that pointed me into the right direction.
It was necessary to set </p>

<pre><code>Configure::write('log', true);
</code></pre>

<p>to ensure that message and error logging works even if debug=0 (added this in bootstrap).<br>
By the way the 1.3 cookbook exlicitely states that logging is enabled by default even if debug=0. That might be a glitch in the documentation.</p>
