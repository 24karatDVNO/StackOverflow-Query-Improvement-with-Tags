<p>If you have the devkit setup correct as @Tomasz mentions, please make sure you check the compatibility of mysql2 gem version with windows, I have experienced in the past for it to cause issues and had to go and install a previous version to get it working. Last I remember v0.2.6 was the version that supported windows.</p>
