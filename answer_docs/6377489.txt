<p>Try this:</p>

<pre><code>$numbers = Array ( 
[0] =&gt; 111
[1] =&gt; 222
[2] =&gt; 333 
[3] =&gt; 444 
[4] =&gt; 555 
[5] =&gt; 666 
[6] =&gt; 777 
[7] =&gt; 888 
);

$text = Array ( 
[0] =&gt; love 
[1] =&gt; home 
[2] =&gt; google 
[3] =&gt; money 
);
$new_array = array();
foreach($numbers as $value){
   $new_array
}
</code></pre>

<p></strike></p>

<p>I was just about to try this then I remembered.  Array keys have to be <strong>unique</strong> -- In other words you <strong>cannot</strong> have 2 elements in the array with the same key.</p>
