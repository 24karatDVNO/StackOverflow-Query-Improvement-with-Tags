<p>This is not a direct answer to your question, but would your superior go for a <em>different</em> pre-built validation method? I'm partial to <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/validator/index.html" rel="nofollow">FlowPlayers jQuery based validator</a>. Very simple to setup:</p>

<pre><code>$("#myform").validator();
</code></pre>

<p>I've written several validation frameworks in the past. I finally got tired of reinventing the wheel.</p>
