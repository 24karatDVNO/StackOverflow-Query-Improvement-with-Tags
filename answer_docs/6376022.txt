<p>I would imagine (though I haven't used Rhodes properly myself) that due to the way it is written, gems that include C extensions, like Nokogiri, would not work on Rhodes.</p>

I did find this link that might help: <a href="http://wiki.rhomobile.com/index.php/RhodesExtensions#XML_handling" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.rhomobile.com/index.php/RhodesExtensions#XML_handling</a>.</p>
