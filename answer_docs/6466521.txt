<p>It is unnecessary to qualify the friend thusly.</p>

<p>If you just use <code>friend class OtherObject</code>, then the <code>OtherObject</code> class may access the necessary internals.</p>

<p>Personally my Pimpl are just a <code>struct</code> (bundle of data) and I leave the methods to operate on it in the original class.</p>
