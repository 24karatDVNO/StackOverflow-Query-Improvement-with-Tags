<p>I got this error as well.  It's not an ideal answer but this is what worked for me...  </p>

<p>The type of my property that was causing the error was a decimal.  I converted this to int throughout the project, built the solution and then converted it back to decimal and the error went away. </p>

<p>Not sure why this corrected the problem, but it worked for me.</p>
