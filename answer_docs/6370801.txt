<p>You can add the following to your home page</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function() {
     //Open your lightbox here
};
</code></pre>

<p>Or you can use Jquery all together with something like...</p>

<pre><code>$(function(){
   $(body).load(function(){
      // Open your lightbox here
   });
});
</code></pre>

<p>both of the above will fire the lightbox once the page is loaded. Its probably better to use the jquery example as this will ensure that the DOM is ready.</p>
