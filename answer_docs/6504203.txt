<p>integer literals are <code>int</code> type by default. You need to add <code>f</code> for float, <code>d</code> for double and <code>L</code> for long. <code>L</code> is preferred to <code>l</code> as the later can look like <code>1</code></p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>31 &lt;= 31 as an int
3l &lt;= looks like 31 but is 3 as a long.
31L &lt;= 31 as a long.
311 &lt;= is 311 as an int.
</code></pre>
