<p>I would also recommend to look at the parallel processing toolbox for such a thing, the functionality you want should be in there somewhere. I think it's cleaner that way than trying to synchronize two instances of MATLAB (unless you are forced to use two instances).</p>

<p>In the odd case that there is no such thing, you might also look at different environments to implement what you want. It might be a bit of a workaround, but you can always interface your MATLAB code with other languages (e.g. Java, .NET, C, ...) and use the functionality you are accustomed to there. With Java you are quite sure that your solution is platform independent, .NET only works on Windows (at least in combination with MATLAB).</p>
