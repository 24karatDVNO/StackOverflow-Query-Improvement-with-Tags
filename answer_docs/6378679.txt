<p>If you just want to get rid of the spaces: </p>

<pre><code>TextBox1.Text.Replace(" ",string.Empty)
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you want to substitute another character (underscore) then try:</p>

<pre><code>TextBox1.Text.Replace(" ","_")
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to include the space then @Teoman has your answer...</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean by "<em>handle</em>".</p>
