<p>Add the following to your apps onCreate() method:</p>

<pre><code>WebSettings settings = this.appView.getSettings();
settings.setSupportZoom(true);
settings.setBuiltInZoomControls(true);
</code></pre>

<p>It won't work if your ROM does not support mulit-touch but since it is already working in your browser this should do it.</p>
