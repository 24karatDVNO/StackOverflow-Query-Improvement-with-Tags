<p>I just stumbled upon another open source library that provides a high performance collections for primitives -- HPPC <a href="http://labs.carrotsearch.com/hppc.html" rel="nofollow">http://labs.carrotsearch.com/hppc.html</a> </p>

<p>They were motivated by performance issues on autoboxing, and well, having primitives directly supported in collections.  </p>

<p>Looks pretty good.</p>
