<p>this syntax is near what you were talking about:</p>

<pre><code>;with myXml as
(
select 
  a.value('@ClassID', 'uniqueidentifier') as ClassID,
  a.value('@UserID', 'varchar(50)') as UserID
  from @xml.nodes('root/row') as x(a)
)
select * from myXml
where classid = '99c24704-bfdb-4350-a35b-102cf5699edb'
</code></pre>
