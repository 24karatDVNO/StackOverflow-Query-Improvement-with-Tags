<p>I propably would have a look at Python Twisted for COMP1 for reading the sensor values in Python and serving as websocket server. COMP2 could be a simple device with a decent webbrowser with websocket support and some javascript to process the data. Pretty simple solution and since you only have to support 1 computer/browser you don't need to deal with a fallback for non websocket browsers.</p>
