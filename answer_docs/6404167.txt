<p>From what you posted, I have the following solution in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your <code>ListActivity</code> contains all the
products you have.</li>
<li>If you click on one of those
products, a new Activity is launched
which provides more informations
about the product (for example in a
<code>WebView</code>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The "next" and "previous"-buttons you describe would be placed on this Activity, too.</p>

<p>I guess all your product informations are stored in an SQLiteDatabase? If so, every product should have an ID which can be used the find the "next"- and "previous"-products in your <code>Show</code>-Activity.</p>
