<p>My suggestion would be to not make it too complicated and not over think things.  There really is no need to do anything more complicated than this.</p>

<pre><code> public function clone():Thing {
     var t:Thing = new Thing();

     t.x = this.x;
     t.y = this.y;
     t.val1 = this.val1;
     t.val2 = this.val2;

     return t;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>and if you have a parameters in your constructor.</p>

<pre><code>public function Thing(x:int,y:int) {
    this.x = x;
    this.y = y;
}

public function clone():Thing {
    var t:Thing = new Thing(this.x, this.y);

    t.val1 = this.val1;
    t.val2 = this.val2;

    return t;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I do like the other answer, it's clever but a lot of churn for just setting some properties. Don't over think the problem.</p>
