<p>I believe the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/libs/type_traits/doc/html/boost_typetraits/reference/is_polymorphic.html" rel="nofollow">is_polymorphic Boost type trait</a> is the one you are looking for. You might want to take a look at <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/libs/type_traits/doc/html/index.html" rel="nofollow">the other type traits</a> as well if there is one better suited for the task. Beware though, a lot of them are unimplemented, always check the documentation.</p>
