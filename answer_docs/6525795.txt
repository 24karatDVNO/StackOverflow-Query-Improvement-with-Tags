<p>You could use a WebView to display a Website inside your application. See <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/webapps/webview.html" rel="nofollow">this article</a>. If you want to display only one div of a website, you could move this div to another page. This should be the easiest method to achieve your goal.</p>

<p>BTW: There are no stupid questions ;-)</p>
