<p>I have tried <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/orgchart.html" rel="nofollow">Google Org Chart</a>. It is free and pretty simple to use. I have used it to create a dynamic org chart in SharePoint. There are a few <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-api-issues/issues/list?can=2&amp;q=org%20chart&amp;sort=-stars&amp;colspec=ID%20Type%20Status%20Priority%20Milestone%20Owner%20Summary%20Stars" rel="nofollow">issues</a> with it. But overall I was satisfied with it.</p>
