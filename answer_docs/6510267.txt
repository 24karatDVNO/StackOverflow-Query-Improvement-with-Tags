<p>Not sure if this is what you want. If you just have two row per group, you may try this.</p>

<pre><code>;WITH cte as
(
    -- You sql output here
    SELECT  *
    FROM    table
)
SELECT  a1.group,a1.date1,a1.value1,a2.date2,a2.value2
FROM    cte a1
INNER JOIN cte a2
 ON a2.date2 IS NOT NULL
 AND a1.group = a2.group
WHERE a1.date1 IS NOT NULL
</code></pre>
