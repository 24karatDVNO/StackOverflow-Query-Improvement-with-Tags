<p>Some profilers give very nice indications of where bottlenecks in your code are.  For example - the CodeAnalyst (for AMD chips only) has the instructions per cycle ratio.  I'm sure intel profilers are similar.</p>

<p>As Billy O'Neal says though, if your runnning on an 8-core, being stuck on 10 percent of cpu is about right.  If this is your problem then Windows msvc++ has a parallel mode (the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd492418.aspx" rel="nofollow">parallel patterns library</a>) for the standard algorithms.  This can give parallelisation for free if have written your loops the c++ way (its still your responsibility to make sure your loops are thread safe).  I've not used the msvc version but the <code>gnu::__parallel_for_each</code> etc work a treat.</p>
