<p>Regarding your 5 minute observation, I found that my idle-timeout for the application-pool had defaulted to 5 mins (although the default should be 20 mins in IIS 7.0).</p>

<p>Check out the "Advanced Settings" for your application pool -> Process Model -> Idle-timeout (minutes). You can disable the timeout completely by entering the value 0.</p>
