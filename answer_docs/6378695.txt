<p>I had this issue before if I was either missing the Distribution certificate, or had a duplicate for some reason.  Check Keychain Access to be sure you have a <em>single</em> valid distribution profile for the developer cert that the ad hoc profile is signed against (which you can verify in the profile portal)</p>
