<p>Take a look at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4887820/how-do-you-pass-an-object-from-form1-to-form2-and-back-to-form1/4887906#4887906">a previous answered post</a>.  </p>

Then, in the click / add / save / whatever of the second form, reference the first form and set it directly (or indirectly via a public property getter/setter).</p>
