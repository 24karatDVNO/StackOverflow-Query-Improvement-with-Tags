<p>This is about specificity. <code>form input[type=submit]</code> is more specific, so will override a class.  If you use an id on your element it will be more specific still, and so will override your general rule.</p>

<pre><code>form #submitButton {
    /* strongly specific rules */
}
</code></pre>
