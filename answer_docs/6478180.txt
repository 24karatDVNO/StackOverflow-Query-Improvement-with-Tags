<p>I'm sorry.  I figured it out... I had been searching for the solution for a couple of hours and gave up and turned to stackoverflow 2 minutes before the miracle... </p>

<p>Despite having a custom cell with a tag to the uilabel, I was assigning the text to cell.textLabel.text = @"blah blah";</p>

<p>When I assigned the text to the tagged label, all was well.  Sorry and thanks!</p>
