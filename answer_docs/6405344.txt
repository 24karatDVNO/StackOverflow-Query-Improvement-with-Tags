<p>Your intent is not to just copy the elemnt, your intent is to transform it: the namespace is part of the element name in XML just like in C# or in Java. So you have to apply some hand-coding using XPath and focus on the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xpath.xpathnavigator.localname.aspx" rel="nofollow">local name</a>, or for more involved stuff maybe even resort to XSLT.</p>
