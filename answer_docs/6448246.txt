<p>I don't have a specific answer to your question but there are two plugins that do exactly what you are trying to do.  I've linked them below.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Simple Expires 
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-expires/" rel="nofollow">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-expires/</a></p></li>
<li><p>Post Expirator
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-expirator/" rel="nofollow">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/post-expirator/</a></p></li>
</ol>

<p>Both seem to be exactly what you are trying to accomplish.</p>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
