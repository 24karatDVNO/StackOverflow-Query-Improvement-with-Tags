<p>If you want to completely encapsulate the idea of a shape, it should not be a hierarchy, as there are an infinite number of shapes in the universe.  Instead, it should just be one Shape class.  It should consist of a series of lines and curves.  Then, you can have methods to check if it conforms to particular shape definitions, e.g. <code>IsCircle()</code>, <code>IsSquare()</code> etc...</p>

<p>You could also have methods and/or constructors that set it to a particular type of shape.</p>
