<p>Fixed.  The answer can be found on my StackOverflow question <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6446892/blackberry-torch-simulator-and-editfield-problem">"Blackberry Torch Simulator and EditField Problem"</a>.  The trick as to subclass directly from Manager.</p>

<p>The issue was the GridFieldManager, which I had subclassed.  I am still not sure how that caused the behaviour I described above.  If anyone has any idea please enlighten me.</p>
