<p>ASP .NET MVC was built with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller" rel="nofollow">Model-View-Controller (MVC)</a> pattern in mind.  That would be the pattern you'd want to use.</p>

<p>In addition to the resources magnifico provided, I know others have recommended the some other tutorials.  I don't know if these have been updated to the latest version of the framework, but they should still serve as decent beginners.</p>

<p>Also the Microsoft Patterns &amp; Practices group recently released <a href="http://silk.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">Project Silk</a> which gets into more advanced techniques involving a lot of AJAX management of the UI.  There's interesting stuff there.</p>
