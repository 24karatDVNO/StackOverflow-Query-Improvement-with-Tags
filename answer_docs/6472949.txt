<p>You don't need to have body or head tags for loaded pages.
Unfortunately if you want reliable cross-browser formatting for loaded pages it's better to go with inline styles for them. Not sure if IE9 will have this fixed, but I beleive earlier versions ignore style for loaded pages whether it's specified in the main page or loaded page itself.</p>
