<p>If you need to just capture STDOUT, doesn't assigning it to a variable do this?  For example:</p>

<pre><code>megabyte=''
# Create a 1 MiB string of NULL characters.
for i in range(1048576):
    megabyte += '\0'
fh=open('zero.bin','w')
# Write an 8 GiB file.
for i in range(8192):
    print(i)
    # Suppress output of 'write()' by assigning to a variable.
    discard=fh.write(megabyte)
fh.close()
</code></pre>

<p>I was creating a large zero-filled file to zero free space on my hard drive and discovered that each call to handle.write(string) spit out the number of bytes written.  Assigning it to a vairable suppressed that output.</p>
