<p>You can put arbitrary values into an <code>order by</code> clause in a query, but none will work easily for a simple "move up/down a row" type things. You can force certain values to sort first or last, but not "put this value after that value, but let that value go into its natural place". You'd need to have an extra field to specify sorting order.</p>
