<p>If your build directory contains cmake_uninstall.cmake file, you can run</p>

<pre><code>cmake -P cmake_uninstall.cmake
</code></pre>

<p>If not, you can only use install_manifest.txt file to manually delete all files.
Also check available make targets, maybe there is "uninstall" or "deinstall" target.</p>
