<p>I happened to have the similar requirement as you:
I want to draw some basic 2D shapes and want the transparent feature when
some shapes overlaps.</p>

<p>After I read the document of Cairo, I found that there are quite a lot concepts to remember.
Hence I did my own search and found <a href="http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PNGwriter</a>.
Although it is a bit outdated that I have to modify the source code a little bit to make it compile with libpng1.4, the syntax is very intuitive and is exactly what I want.
For example, you draw a filled rectangle with <code>pngwritter::filledcircle</code>.</p>

<p>Have a look at its example of plotting a math function:</p>

<p><a href="http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/quickstart-en.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://pngwriter.sourceforge.net/quickstart-en.php</a></p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;pngwriter.h&gt;


int main()
{
   int i;
   int y;

   pngwriter png(300,300,0,"test.png");

   for(i = 1; i &lt; 300;i++)
     {
        y = 150+100*sin((double)i*9/300.0);

        png.plot(i,y, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
     }

   png.close();

   return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>The result is:</p>

<p>Mac OS X 10.6.7 ships with freetype and libpng, all you have to do it to update
the source according to the compilation error, just some quick hacks.</p>
