<p>Yes, there are a couple of approaches you could take.</p>

<p>You can avoid the complexity of doing an extension if you simply write a <a href="http://www.greasespot.net/" rel="nofollow">Greasemonkey</a> script. There are a ton of example scripts at <a href="http://userscripts.org/" rel="nofollow">userscripts.org</a> that you should be able to search for ways to approach your particular project.</p>

<p>If you want to distribute it as an extension, I'd suggest using the <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/1.0/" rel="nofollow">Addon SDK</a>. It makes it really easy to develop and package an extension, and provides a framework called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/1.0/packages/addon-kit/docs/page-mod.html" rel="nofollow">page-mods</a> to modify pages.</p>
