<p>You can achieve it in below way.</p>

<p>I think you are reloading table.</p>

<p>So, when you press particular row, then store it's indexPath.row in local variable.
like currIndexPathRow = indexPath.row
And reload table.</p>

<p>Then check inside "CellForRowAtIndexPath". that if(indexPath.row == currIndexPathRow) then you can set some background image to that particular row.</p>

<p>Hope you have got the point.</p>

<p>Let me know in case of any difficulty.</p>
