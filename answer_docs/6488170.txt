<p>Since the default tag for every UIView is 0, I'm going to guess that there are multiple UIViews with the same tag (tags aren't guaranteed to be unique). Instead, choose an arbitrary high value like 1000, then increment that with each view added.</p>

<p>Also, it would help if you included your UITextField creation code.</p>
