<p>Why don't you just pass the value along to the next view controller i.e. declare a property to store the key. I am pretty sure <code>getMasterKey</code> won't exist as the object can be include in many arrays and dictionaries at once so you can't backtrace unless you keep sort of indicator which in this case is best served by a property in the view controller.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can consider <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/ObjCRuntimeRef/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/objc_setAssociatedObject" rel="nofollow"><code>associated objects</code></a>. You can look at this document for an <a href="http://cocoasamurai.blogspot.com/2010/01/understanding-objective-c-runtime.html" rel="nofollow"><code>example</code></a> and there are a few more on the net. However this would be overdoing it in my opinion unless you've a very specific purpose that using properties won't work.</p>
