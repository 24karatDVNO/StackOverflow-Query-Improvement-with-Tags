<p>Are you looking for a dictionary, where each of your values are keyed to a letter of the alphabet? In that case, you can do:</p>

<pre><code>from string import lowercase as letters

values = [1, 23, 3544, 23]
mydict = {}
for (let, val) in zip(letters, values):
    mydict[let] = val

&lt;&lt;&lt; mydict == {'a': 1, 'c': 23, 'b': 3544, 'd': 23}

&lt;&lt;&lt; mydict['a'] == 1
</code></pre>

<p>You'll have to add additional logic if you need to handle lists longer than the alphabet.</p>
