<p>I honestly thought I wasn't seeing the response I sent, but it was a server-side error.  My success callback is now firing, <em>with</em> the full text of my server's response available as <code>f.responseText</code> (where <code>f</code> is the first argument to the success callback).  My mistake!</p>
