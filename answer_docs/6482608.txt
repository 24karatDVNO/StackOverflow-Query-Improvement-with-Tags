<p>I'm not 100% sure to understand your requirements but a script as the following one should work, except that the result is into an array and not into separate variables.</p>

<pre><code>// uncomment the following line to get rid of paragraph breaks;
// $string = strtr($string, array("\n\n","\n")); 
$lines = explode("\n", $string);
$pagelen = array(14,48,48,48);

$result = array();
foreach($pagelen as $cPageLen)
    array_push($result, join("\n",array_splice($lines, 0, $cPageLen)));
</code></pre>
