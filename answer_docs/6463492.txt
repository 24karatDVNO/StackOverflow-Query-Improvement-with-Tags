<p>Well, jQuery submit does nothing, you need to have a form inside the partial view, then what happen is when the jQuery dialog submit execute, you call your form submit which have the action defined already.</p>

<p>See my code below which is non ajax submit</p>

<pre><code>      }); 
    $dialog
        .dialog("option", "buttons", {
            "Submit":function(){
                var dlg = $(this);
                var $frm = $(frm);
                if(onFormSubmitting != null)
                    onFormSubmitting();
                $frm.submit();
        },
        "Cancel": function() { 
            $(this).dialog("close");
            $(this).empty();
        }    

    });
</code></pre>

<p>And regarding ur question inside post action, you should perform your business logic then call "Return RedirectToAction("viewname",new {id=xxx})"</p>
