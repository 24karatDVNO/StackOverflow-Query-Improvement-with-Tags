<p>Your jar file lacks a file with this name</p>

<pre><code>/org/dav/kin/Tester.class
</code></pre>

<p>or you have special characters in your MANIFEST.MF file</p>

<p>MANIFEST.MF files have a particular syntax.  It's best to use other tools to generate them; however some of the details I've encountered which increases the success of hand written files include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Always make sure the lines are less than 72 characters long.</li>
<li>Always use \r\n (windows newline), even on non-windows systems.</li>
<li>Verify that all whitespace characters are spaces.</li>
<li>Verify that there are no nonprintable characters (htab, etc).</li>
<li>Sometimes a blank line at the end of the file helps.</li>
</ol>
