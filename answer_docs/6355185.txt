<p>If it's a small table (approx 1000 records), you can turn on the Import/Export mode in SQL Assistant. This will help you to export the table as a csv (you can set the Tools-> Options -> Import/Export) and then import the file to your db. </p>

<p>While importing, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO TABLE
VALUES (?,?,?,?);
</code></pre>

<p>The number of ? should be same as the number of columns in the table/file.</p>

<p>If it's a bigger table, Fastexport the data and the import it using Fastload/Multiload. </p>
