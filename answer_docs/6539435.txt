<p>You use an interface to guarantee that any object you receive will behave according to the interface. That's why your <code>QuickInsertQueue</code> needs to implement the methods of <code>PriorityQueue</code>. The only information it can use about the inserted objects, though, is that they behave according to the <code>QueueItem</code> interface&mdash;that is, they have a <code>priority()</code> method that returns an <code>int</code>. Your implementation can rely on that, but nothing else, about the objects it will be managing.</p>
