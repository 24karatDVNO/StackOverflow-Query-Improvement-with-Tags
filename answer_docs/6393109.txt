<p>Entity Framework provides an explicit value for each property. In SQL you can write a query that inserts a value into <code>[Field1]</code> and leave <code>[Field2]</code> and <code>[Field3]</code> blank, and they will use the database default. But since Entity Framework generates the query based on the properties defined on the entity, all columns will always be given a value, so if you want to provide a default value, it will need to be set in the designer, I don't think it gets automatically picked up when the entity model is created.</p>
