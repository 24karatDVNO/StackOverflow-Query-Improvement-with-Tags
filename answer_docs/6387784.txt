<p>As far as I know EMACS is an editor. If you want to change the KeyStrokes for editing command on Swing text components then you need to use Key Bindings. You can use the existing text Actions but just bind them to different KeyStrokes. See <a href="http://tips4java.wordpress.com/2008/10/10/key-bindings/" rel="nofollow">Key Bindings</a> for a list of all the default bindings an some example of how to rebind and Action.</p>
