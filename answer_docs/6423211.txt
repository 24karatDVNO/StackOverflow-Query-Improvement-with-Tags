<p>if you place images inside "Icons/images" then none of your options are correct as you are saying images can be found in /Icons/jquery/image1.jpg</p>

<p>what you need to do is specify the correct path, and it is ideal to use relative path to the root of your site.</p>

<p>/Icons/images/image1.jpg</p>
