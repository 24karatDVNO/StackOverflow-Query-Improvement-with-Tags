<p>AFAIC, ADO.NET/SQL don't support nullable types this way.</p>

<p>The last example looks closest to correct to me. What kind of issues are you having with it? If you are just getting a compile error related to types, type cast your value to object:</p>

<pre><code>(object)DependencyID.Value;
</code></pre>

<p>Since both values on either side of <code>:</code> must be of the same type.</p>
