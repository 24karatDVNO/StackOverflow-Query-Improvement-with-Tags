<p>I can assure you there is no way to safely do what you are asking. A crafty hacker will always be able to exploit a system that allows arbitrary html from the user, even when cleaned up by stripping away certain tags. This is exactly why tools like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" rel="nofollow">markdown</a> and <a href="http://www.bbcode.org/" rel="nofollow">BBcode</a> exist. Why look, even StackOverflow is using similar.</p>

<p>The road you are considering traveling down is littered with 10,000 exploited web sites.</p>
