<p>You would have to write some reflection to iterate through all the types in your assembly and register them all in Unity. This isn't too much of a hardship - should be just a simple call to Assembly.GetTypes()  to retrieve all types and then iterate over them, registering each one into Unity with the appropriate interceptor.</p>

<p>If you use full-blown Interceptors rather than Policies they will by default act over all method calls on any type that they are registered with.</p>
