<p>you have developped your application on version 2.2, which means that your app will work only on sdk 2.2 or higher , because possibly you have used some packages and classes which arent exist on sdk2.1 , </p>

<p>to make your app work on sdk2.1 , change the sdk of your application to 2.1 , and modify ( if necessary ) the code that is not supported on 2.1 .</p>
