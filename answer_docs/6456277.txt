<p>This is normal. The more results you have the longer it takes to produce the output. Try to paginate the results. If you get the first 100 results 1..100 it will be much faster. Later you could use the same query but 101..200 etc.</p>

<p>Another problem could be RAM. The more results you have the more storage you need to save them before they are returned.</p>
