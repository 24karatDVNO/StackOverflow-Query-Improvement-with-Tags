<p>Experimental is just that. Experimental. It could have breaking changes in an release of chrome. The other downsides of experimental is only being available in the dev channel of Chrome (or more unstable such as canary), extensions using experimental can not be uploaded to the Web Store, and user have to have the enable experimental extensions flag.</p>

<p>If you still want to use the experimental webRequest API I wrote a simple example in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6447082/using-chrome-experimental-webrequest-api-to-change-loaded-file/6462991#6462991">another answer</a>.</p>
