<p>The easiest solution is to clone the database locally to your laptop, and use JNDI definitions (which you can put in ~/.pentaho/simple-jndi/default.properties for PRD, and configure with Pentaho Administration Console for bi-server) - and as long as the JNDI sources have the same name, and point to databases with the same schema, your reports should work fine when you deploy them.</p>
