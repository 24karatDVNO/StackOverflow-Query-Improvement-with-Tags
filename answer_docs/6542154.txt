<p>One way would be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  count(*) AS totalNulls, 
  0 as totalNumbers
FROM MyTable AS t
where t.MyField is null
union 
SELECT 
  0 AS totalNulls, 
  count(t.MyField) AS totalNumbers
FROM MyTable AS t
where t.MyField like '[0-9]';
</code></pre>

<p>The first row will contain the null count, the second row will contain the total count of t.MyField that contains digits.</p>
