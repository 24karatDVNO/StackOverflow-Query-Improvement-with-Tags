<p>in onItemSelected I would do something like:</p>

<pre><code>public void  onItemSelected  (AdapterView&lt;?&gt;  parent, View  v, int position, long id) {
   if(mPreviousView != null) //remove logic

   mPreviousView = v;

   // Other View stuff ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Where mPreviousView is declared outside like:</p>

<pre><code>private View mPreviousView;
</code></pre>

<p>I have found this method to work better then findViewById plus/minus logic. If the view is null that means we don't have a previous view just yet.</p>
