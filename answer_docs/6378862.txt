<pre><code>if (this == o) return true;
</code></pre>

<p>The above statement is redundant. </p>

<p>More specifically, it's simply checking to see if you are comparing an object <strong>to itself</strong> ... so it can skip the code below it. For example: </p>

<pre><code>Foo f = new Foo();
f.equals(f); //the if (this == o) would be true. References the same thing.
</code></pre>

<p>Note: As an aside, if one overrides equals, one should override hashcode() to maintain the general contract for hashcode() - equal objects must have the same hashcode (the reverse is not true since two objects could have the same hash but not be equal.)</p>
