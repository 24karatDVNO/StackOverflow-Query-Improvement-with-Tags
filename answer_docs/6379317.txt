<p>I think I found the answer... By default, it should work. Debugging a vanilla asp.net application on my laptop should be fine because it is running in the context of me, and I have the keys to the kingdom when it comes to encryption/decryption. HOWEVER, the application I am trying to debug runs impersonated as a different user (and thus does not have the proper access). So, the solution is going to be to debug on my laptop not impersonating the user, and then when it migrates out to QA and production, make sure the code is in place to impersonate, etc</p>
