<p><a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html" rel="nofollow">This page</a> explains Safari's viewport and how to change it. It will probably fix the font size problem and maybe help with the page size.</p>

<p>Basically, Safari by default simulates a screen that's about 900px wide, when it's actually about 300px (so the page appears zoomed out). This makes pages designed for real computers render properly, but for a web app you usually don't want it to zoom the page at all. The viewport tag should let you control that.</p>
