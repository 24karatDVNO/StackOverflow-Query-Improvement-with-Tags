<p>1 - Try <code>Project &gt; Clean</code> and rebuild project</p>

<p>2 - If clean does not solve this issue, check <strong>ALL</strong> log in your <code>Console</code> view in Eclipse.</p>

<p>The issue may not be reported at the end of the <code>Console</code> view. In my case, it was a drawable that does not respect the 9-patch format. This was reported somewhere in the <code>Console</code> view but <strong>not at the end</strong> !!!</p>
