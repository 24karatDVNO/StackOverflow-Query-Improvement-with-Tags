<p>iPad, iPad 2, iPod touch, and iPhone all use iOS. Other than possible issues like "Oh, I assumed a resolution here that doesn't hold true for this device...", programming for one is the same as programming for another.</p>

<p>This is especially true for the iPad and the iPad 2, since they are very similar pieces of hardware. I wouldn't be surprised if an iPad program worked perfectly on the iPad 2 without any adjustments.</p>

<p>As for java, etc., sorry, Apple doesn't want to make anything too easy. You have to stick with C++ or, preferably, Objective C (since Objective C comes with a lot of iOS specific functions.)</p>
