<p>Touches are not very precise, because fingers are not very precise (<em>much</em> less so than a mouse cursor), and because the tracking hardware isn't very precise (because it doesn't need to, because of finger size - it <em>does not work</em> without significant touched area).</p>

<p>That being said, the iDevices have very good touchscreens compared to many other capacitive touch devices. I'm just not sure pixel-precision is attainable in practice.</p>

<p>It's easy to experiment with this, though.</p>
