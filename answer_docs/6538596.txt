<p>Inspired by tybro's answer, I came up with this, which solves a problem in your question. If the textbox is a fixed length, what happens if the last letter is not visible at all? What co-ordinate should be reported then? Anyway, this gets around it by expanding the textbox indefinitely.</p>

<pre><code>// markup
&lt;div id="textbox"&gt;
    &lt;span id="edit" contentEditable&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span id="end"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="report"&gt;x:? , y:?&lt;/div&gt;


// css
#textbox {
    border: solid black 1px;
    min-height: 1em;
    white-space: nowrap;
}


// javascript
$(function() {
    $('#textbox').click(function() {
         $('#edit').focus();
    });

    $('#edit').keypress(function() {
        var endoff = $('#end').offset();
        $('#report').html('x:' + endoff.left + ' , y:' + endoff.top);
    });
});
</code></pre>

<p>The only thing I'm not sure of is when does <code>keypress</code> fire if it's before the content has changed, that's a problem. You could get round it by introducing a timeout or probably theres an even better solution. Unfortunately the <code>keyup</code> event doesn't seem to work on <code>contentEditable</code> things (in Firefox 5 anyway).</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
