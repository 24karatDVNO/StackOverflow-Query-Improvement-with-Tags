<p>With the frameworks today and url routing they provide I don't even need to use mod_rewrite to create friendly urls such <a href="http://somedomain.com/pic/1" rel="nofollow">http://somedomain.com/pic/1</a> so I doubt you can detect anything. I would create such urls for all visitors, crawlers or not. Maybe you can spoof some bot headers to pretend you're a known crawler and see if there's any change. Dunno how legal that is tbh.</p>
