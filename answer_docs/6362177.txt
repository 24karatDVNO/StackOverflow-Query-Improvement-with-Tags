<p>I don't know why but the MySQLWorkbench GUI didn't display the Point variables, at least in my computer. </p>

<p>Then I tried to query the DB from a php script and it printed the Points perfectly, so the DB actually stored them. It was just a GUI display problem. Should I report it as a bug to MySQL?</p>
