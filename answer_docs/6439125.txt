<p>Make a subview of UIView. In it, override drawRect: to draw your circle. Add it to a superview that is the size of the screen. Then, give your view a UIPanGestureRecognizer. Set the target/action to a method on your circle view, and in that method set the view's frame to have an origin at the gesture recogniser's locationInView:.</p>

<p>If you need more specific help than this, feel free to post some code that you're having trouble with.</p>
