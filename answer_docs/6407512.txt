<p>in general cheking is good idea especially when you're firing some event when value is changed it prevents you from doing some unneeded or even unwanted job to be done.
I don't see why woud u want to fire event when value is the same. If u want to, then its better to fire it manually then doing something that someone else might not expect.</p>
