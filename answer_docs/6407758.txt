<p>The chance of a user 'consuming' more than 100 items in one go is very small, even if the items have very little detail, maybe add navigation (categories etc) as filters to the data so the user will only get the 20 or so items they are actually interested in. Tree views can be quite handy to break lists up into smaller lists that are more relevant to users, but there are many ways of doing this...</p>
