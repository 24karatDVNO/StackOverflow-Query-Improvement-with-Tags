<p>It seems you didn't close with parens in the right place. Did you mean this?</p>

<pre><code>class ModelManager{
  def getModel(model: String) = {
    model match{
      // snip
    }
  } // end method here

  def deleteInstance(model:String, uid: Long) = {
    Model.all(getModel(model)).filter("uid", uid).get().delete()
  }    
} 
</code></pre>

<p>It does not look like you're trying to define a recursive method... Then you're likely to have other issues to resolve as you need a method that returns Class[_] not a combination of <code>Boolean</code> and <code>Class[_]</code> (which would be <code>Any</code>). So may be this would work better?</p>

<pre><code>def getModel(model: String): Class[_] = {
  model match{
    case "menu" =&gt; classOf[Menu]
    case "articles" =&gt; classOf[Articles]
} // end method here
</code></pre>
