<p>It all depends on what version of iOS you are developing for.
In an ideal world, you would be able to test your product on all the devices that support the OS you are developing.
If this is not an option, you should just need the bare minimum devices that the OS can run on:</p>

<p>iOS 3: iPhone (original), iPod Touch (1st generation), iPad</p>

<p>iOS 4: iPhone 3G, iPod Touch (2nd generation), iPad</p>

<p>iOS 5: iPhone 3GS, iPod Touch (3rd generation), iPad</p>

<p>One can assume that if your product runs well on these devices, it will run well (if not better) on devices of greater power.</p>
