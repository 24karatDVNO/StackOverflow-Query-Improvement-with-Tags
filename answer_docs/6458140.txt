<p>when you use a ProcessBuilder you instantiate a Process Object it's java representation of a batch execution</p>

<p>Tipically you can hook process streaming via Java API.</p>

<p>Extracted from Process JAVA API:</p>

<ul>
<li>abstract 
InputStream  getErrorStream() 
         Gets the error stream of the subprocess</li>
<li>abstract 
InputStream  getInputStream() 
         Gets the input stream of the subprocess</li>
<li>abstract 
OutputStream getOutputStream() 
         Gets the output stream of the subprocess</li>
</ul>

<p>If perl script write on standard output stream then you can read that output.</p>

<p>Generally, If process doesn't write on standard output stream then you cannot read it.</p>
