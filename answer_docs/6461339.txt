<p>I recently got the same error while attempting to use glBitmapString(). I was using vs2008. I set a breakpoint at the function call and stepped into it (using freeglut_font.c). Inside I noticed that the exception was being thrown upon what was described to be glut not being initialized. So inside my initialization function I added... </p>

<pre><code>char* argv[] = {"some","stuff"};    int argc=2;
glutInit(&amp;argc,argv);   
glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DEPTH | GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGBA);
glutInitWindowPosition(100,100);
glutInitWindowSize(800,600);
</code></pre>

<p>Where of course you can use whatever argc/argv you please. This, as well as what was suggested by Marnix solved the exception errors for me.</p>

<p>Note that I don't actually create a window with glut.</p>
