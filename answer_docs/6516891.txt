<p>MySQL supports the "REPLACE" operation, which will delete an existing row and recreate it (probably not exactly what you are looking for): <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replace.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replace.html</a></p>

<p>What you are really looking for is "INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE": <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/insert-on-duplicate.html</a></p>

<p>Their first example on that page seems to be what you described:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO table (a,b,c) VALUES (1,2,3)
  ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE c=c+1;
</code></pre>

<p>It works when the INSERT causes a conflict on the primary key or a unique key, and then runs as an UPDATE.</p>
