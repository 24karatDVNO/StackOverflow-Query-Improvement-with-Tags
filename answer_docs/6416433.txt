<p>You've missed out my recommendation:</p>

<p>Write it in code.</p>

<p>It's not very hard to knock up a little DSL which can support your BDD. <a href="http://code.google.com/p/wipflash/source/browse/Example.PetShop.Scenarios/PetRegistrationAndPurchase.cs" rel="nofollow">Here's one I made earlier.</a> Even business people can read this.</p>

<p>The only reason to use BDD frameworks, really, is to capture the conversations you have with your business stakeholders. The conversations are <a href="http://lizkeogh.com/2011/03/04/step-away-from-the-tools/" rel="nofollow">much more important</a>! If your business stakeholders aren't reading or writing the scenarios themselves then all you do with a BDD framework is introduce another layer of indirection. (I helped write JBehave and still prefer code.)</p>

<p>Having said that, if you feel you get benefit from a BDD framework, I hear great things about SpecFlow.</p>
