<p>Easiest way, going by what you're requesting, although you didn't specify how many numbers you wanted to add. so for loop won't work that way. you're best off with a while loop.</p>

<pre><code>$foo = array();
$i = 1;
while (some end condition) {
   array_push($foo, $i);
   $i++;
}
print_r($foo);
</code></pre>
