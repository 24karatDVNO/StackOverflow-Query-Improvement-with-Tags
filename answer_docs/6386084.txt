<p>In case of complete changes of the lists, the <code>ObservableCollection</code> does little to help you. You might find it easier to have the combo boxes have <code>ItemsSource</code> to properties on the ViewModel which return an <code>IEnumerable&lt;T&gt;</code> and call <code>PropertyChanged</code> when a particular item box is selected (<code>SelectedItem</code> is set).</p>
