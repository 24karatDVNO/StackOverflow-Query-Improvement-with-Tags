<p>Do you have Automatically declare stage instances turned on (Publish Settings>Flash>Settings)? If not make sure it is.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, try changing <code>public class Main</code> to <code>public dynamic class Main</code>.</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, see if <code>var bg:MovieClip = MovieClip(getChildByName("bg"))</code> works.</p>

<p>If you're still stuck, we'll need to see more code.</p>
