<p>I'm not 100% positive what you're going for, but <a href="http://wolframalpha.com" rel="nofollow">WolframAlpha</a> has a <a href="http://products.wolframalpha.com/developers/" rel="nofollow">developer interface</a> you may be able to use.</p>

<p>They also seem to have a <a href="http://products.wolframalpha.com/api/libraries.html" rel="nofollow">java library</a> already, though the free version appears to be limited to 2k queries (Don't know if thats a feasible limitation).</p>
