<p>First create a model with whatever the basic fields you require for a post(say <code>Post</code> model). Then you can create a model for sources - <code>Source</code> model. <code>Post</code> model should have a foreign key representing the source with which it was created. The <code>Source</code> model should contain a field to store the name of a model to instantiate in order to store additional fields of the posts with the given source. Then create the all the models for each additional field sets you require, Each should have a foreign key field with the <code>Post</code> model. For example you can create a <code>Poll</code> model with a foreign key to <code>Post</code>. </p>

<p>After modeling the data like this you can just refer to <code>Source</code> model to resolve all the field types when creating posts as well as retrieving them.</p>
