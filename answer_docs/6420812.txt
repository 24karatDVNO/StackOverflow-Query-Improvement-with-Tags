<p>As others have said you need to install rails from gem via</p>

<pre><code>gem install rails
</code></pre>

<p>The other somewhat tricky thing is that when you change into the rails app directory you need to make sure the dependencies are met for that app by doing:</p>

<pre><code>bundle install
</code></pre>

<p>I've gone into a bit more detail on getting Rails 3 set up under Ubuntu at <a href="http://blog.dcxn.com/2011/06/21/rolling-with-rails-3-on-ubuntu-11-04/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.dcxn.com/2011/06/21/rolling-with-rails-3-on-ubuntu-11-04/</a></p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
