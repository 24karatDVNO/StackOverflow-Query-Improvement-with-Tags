<p>The automatic labels will always appear above the point. You can create annotations to label your data points. For each label, use <code>CPTPlotSpaceAnnotation</code>, anchor it to the coordinates of the data point, and set the displacement and content anchor.</p>

<p>To put the labels to the right of the point, set the displacement to (x, 0) where x is the number of pixels between the label and the center of the data point. Set the content anchor to (0, 0.5).</p>
