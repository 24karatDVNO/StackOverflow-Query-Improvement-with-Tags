<p>I am not sure this will help, but with this <a href="http://ppewww.physics.gla.ac.uk/~tdoherty/Octopus/OctopusPatch/octopus-3.0/docs/extras/tools/p6spy/index.htm" rel="nofollow">driver</a>, this helps in tracing all the DML operations you perform on the database including commit &amp; rollback. When you use <a href="http://www.findjar.com/jar/p6spy/p6spy/1.3/p6spy-1.3.jar.html?all=true" rel="nofollow">p6spy</a>
it logs every database hit into a log file, from where you can easily figure out where your application is performing a commit.</p>

<p>Apart from the above suggestion, I fell every database comes with some sort of monitoring tools, which with you can monitor which DML is fired within a span of time.</p>
