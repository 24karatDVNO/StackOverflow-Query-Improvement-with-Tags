<p>Compare your program to this. It might help.</p>

<pre><code>fibonacci = [1,2]
num = 3
while num &lt; 4000000:
    fibonacci.append(num)
    len_ = len(fibonacci)
    num = fibonacci[len_-2] + fibonacci[len_-1]

sum = 0
for num in fibonacci:
    if num%2 == 0: sum += num

print sum
</code></pre>

<p>I don't understand why are you unnecessary removing the odd numbered entries from the list. Just add the even numbered ones that's it.</p>
