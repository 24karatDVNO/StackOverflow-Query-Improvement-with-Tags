<p>Don't forget to clean your Temporary ASP.Net (c:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework[version]\Temporary ASP.NET Files) files. </p>

<p>After that, do a rebuild and try.</p>

<p>Also, for local development, if you can, then do not GAC assemblies. GAC them while deploying to integration environment. THis will help speed up development a bit.</p>
