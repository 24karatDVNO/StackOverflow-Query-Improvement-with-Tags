<p>You want to fetch data from 2 tables and when you using join in this case you must use left join to reach your result change your inner join to left join</p>

<p>I think it works </p>

<pre><code>$sql="SELECT _location.locationname, _countries.countryname FROM _location 
LEFT JOIN _countries ON _location.countryid='".$q."'";
</code></pre>
