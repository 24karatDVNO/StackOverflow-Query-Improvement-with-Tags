<p><code>#carousel p</code> is floating left, and not taking all of the width - <code>#slider1</code> is floating left and IE is starting from the position that remains after <code>#carousel p</code></p>

<p>Adding clear:left; to <code>#slider1</code> should do the trick. My IE7 does not have web tools to change CSS on the fly to debug for IE7</p>
