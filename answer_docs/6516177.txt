<p>I'm currently working on a HTML5 BomberMan-clone and at first I tried to make some best-implementations of JavaScript gameLoops (google), but in the end I ended with a simple setTimeout(...) gameLoop :).</p>

<p>And as it seems it's working quite nicely and smooth. I have still lots of work to do, but you can see the current-dev-version (setTimeout is set for 30 FPS - but if I set it to 60 FPS - no problems at all) here: </p>

<p>(and thanks Simon for your drawing-optimizations comments all the time here on StackOverflow)</p>
