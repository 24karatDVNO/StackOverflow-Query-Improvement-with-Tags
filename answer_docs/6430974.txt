<p>If you want your unit tests for layer that talks with database to have the real value and all behaviors like in production code, you need to talk with database. It may be considered as breaking the rule of having no dependencies in unit test, but there's no other way to have LINQ to Entities doing its job than letting it talk with <strong>real</strong> database. It may (and probably should) be an in-memory database - see for example <a href="http://ayende.com/blog/3983/nhibernate-unit-testing" rel="nofollow">how is Ayende doing it</a>.</p>
