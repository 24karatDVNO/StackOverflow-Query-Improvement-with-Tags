<p>The <strong>-></strong> operator is used with pointers, to access methods and members. A pointer needs to get the address of an object.</p>

<p>So, because you have an array of actual objects, and not an array of pointers, you need to get a reference to their address.<br>
You can get the address of an object (unless the operator is overloaded) with the <strong>&amp;</strong> operator.</p>
