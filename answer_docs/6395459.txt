<p>My idea to find out the sqlite database in monodroid is, </p>

<ul>
<li><p>-First Install any android File Explorer application in your
emulator.</p></li>
<li><p>-Then using the application just select any location you want to store your database.</p></li>
<li><p>-Then Use "adb push  " command in adb. to copy your source<br>
database to a mobile location that<br>
you have selected.</p></li>
<li><p>-So now you know path of the database.</p></li>
<li><p>-Just use that path in your program.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Thank you...</p>
