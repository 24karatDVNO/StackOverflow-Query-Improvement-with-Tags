<p>What dou you think about this solution?</p>

<p>EDIT: Replace User with AssignmentSheet and Task with Assignment for this example to fit the original question.</p>

<p>Some routes:</p>

<pre><code># routes.rb
put "assignment_usage/assignment_sheet/:assignment_sheet_id/assignment/:assignment_id" =&gt; "assignment_usage#create"
  delete "assignment_usage/assignment_sheet/:assignment_sheet_id/assignment/:assignment_id" =&gt; "assignment_usage#destroy"
</code></pre>

<p>And the controller code:</p>

<pre><code># app/controllers/assignment_usage_controller.rb
class AssignmentUsageController &lt; ApplicationController
  before_filter :load_instances

  # PUT /assignment_usage/assignment_sheet/:assignment_sheet_id/assignment/:assignment_id
  def create
    @assignment.assignment_sheets &lt;&lt; @assignment_sheet
    redirect_to(@assignment_sheet, :notice =&gt; "Assignment has been successfully added.")
  end

  # DELETE /assignment_usage/assignment_sheet/:assignment_sheet_id/assignment/:assignment_id
  def destroy
    @assignment.assignment_sheets.delete @assignment_sheet
    redirect_to(@assignment_sheet, :notice =&gt; "Assignment has been successfully removed.")
  end

  private
  def load_instances
    @assignment_sheet = AssignmentSheet.find(params[:assignment_sheet_id])
    @assignment       = Assignment.find(params[:assignment_id])
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Maybe it is a little bit more clear to use a seperate resource for this.</p>
