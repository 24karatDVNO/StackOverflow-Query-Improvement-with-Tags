<p>I'm experiencing this with 2.0rc2, IE8, Java as well. The problem I have with implementing a solution that can send multiple clicks is that sometimes it <em>does</em> work. In those cases clicking my objects twice does not let the rest of my test move forward. Sending the "Enter" keystroke does not work on our controls either.</p>

<p>There is a similar issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=414" rel="nofollow"><strong>logged</strong></a> for this, but my objects are not necessarily near the "viewpoint". Any more suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
