<p>It turns out I was calling the same SQL method in two different places in very quick succession before the  statements had a chance to be finalised each time. I guess this caused some sort of overlap eventually leading to the statements becoming invalid. Thanks for all the help. I will definitely be using CoreData or FMDB next time.</p>
