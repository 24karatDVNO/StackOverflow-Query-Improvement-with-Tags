<p>I have the same issue and I manage to get my own url helper working pretty well. Basically, I have something like this :</p>

<pre><code>def base_url
     "http://" + @actual_subdomain + "/"
end
</code></pre>

<p>And every others helper taht I wrote map to this one. Like ;</p>

<pre><code>def category_url category
    base_url + category.slug
end
</code></pre>
