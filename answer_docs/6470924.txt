<p>You are starting fine. Here is a more complete version of what you have to do regarding enum manipulation:</p>

<pre><code>public void RotateIt(Rotate toRotate, Face facing) {

switch (facing) {
    case North:
        // Include code to rotate from north
        break;
    case West:
        // Include code to rotate from west
        break;
    case East:
        // Include code to rotate from east
        break;
    default: // South
        // Include code to rotate from south
        break;
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this code could be optimized, but it gives you an idea of how to handle <code>enums</code> in <code>switch</code> statements.</p>
