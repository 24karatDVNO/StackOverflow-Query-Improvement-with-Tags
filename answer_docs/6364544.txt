<p>My goal was add text to a Text Box on another form. I had Form1 and Form2. Form2 has a text box control named Text1. In order to make this work, I created a Sub Routine:</p>

<pre><code>public Void WriteToText(string sData)
{
// Here is where I wrote to my textbox
Text1.text = sData;
}
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Form 1 code:</p>

<pre><code>Form2 Frm2 = new Form2();
Frm2.WriteToText("My Data");
</code></pre>
