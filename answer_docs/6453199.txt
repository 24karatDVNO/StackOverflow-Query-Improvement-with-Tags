<p>Lookup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_database" rel="nofollow">temporal databases</a>.  Your data is temporal, in spite of the fact that the dates may currently be in the future.  Presumably the future oriented data you insert now will still have the same form and meaning when the future change takes effect.</p>
