<p>As long as you're happy with IE6 and higher, and you're not wanting any transparency, then you'll be fine.</p>

<p>If you need IE5.5 or lower (please say it isn't true!) or you need transparency in IE6, then you'll have problems.</p>

<p>High-colour PNGs were fully supported at the first attempt in IE6. They had plenty of bugs with it, but there was nothing wrong with their high-colour depth support.</p>

<p>Having said all that, you absolutely must test in all browsers that you want to support. If you're not prepared to test it for yourself in IE6, then frankly, you shouldn't be trying to support IE6 at all.</p>

<p>You can test your site in all versions of IE using a tool like <a href="http://www.my-debugbar.com/wiki/IETester/HomePage" rel="nofollow">IETester</a>.</p>
