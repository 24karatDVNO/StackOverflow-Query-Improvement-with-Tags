<p>I've accepted hross's answer, but it's also possible to do something like this in Solr 1.3 and up, using:</p>

<pre><code>/select?q={!func}map(Category,20,20,1,0)&amp;sort=score desc
</code></pre>

<p>The cool thing is that you can still sort on other fields, so:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;sort=score desc, name asc
</code></pre>
