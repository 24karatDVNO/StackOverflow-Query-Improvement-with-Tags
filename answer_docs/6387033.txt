<p>The <code>1</code> in your line:</p>

<pre><code>val = val +1;
</code></pre>

<p>is an <code>int</code> implicitly, so the result of <code>val + 1</code> is an <code>int</code>. You're trying to assign that value a short, and that can't be done implicitly because you'd risk losing some precision.</p>
