<p>Thanks Ed!</p>

<p>The answer was indeed memory related.  For those of you coming from the PC world like myself, the Mac version of Eclipse PDT uses <em>way</em> more memory.</p>

<p>The answer?</p>

<ul>
<li>Downgrade to the 32 bit version.</li>
<li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/334102/eclipse-memory-settings-when-getting-java-heap-space-and-out-of-memory">Up the memory Eclipse is allowed to use</a>, by a lot.</li>
<li>Close any un-used projects.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The last one was key.</strong>  I used to leave all my projects open and never had any problems.  In order to get things to run on Mac, I had to close all projects except the one I was attempting to debug.</p>
