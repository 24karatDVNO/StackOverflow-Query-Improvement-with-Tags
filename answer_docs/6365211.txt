<p>I've been working on a project with the kinect for two months and I'm using the OpenNI and NITE libraries and they work like a charm!</p>

<p>I don't know what kind of project you want to do, but using those libraries gives you a lot of tools to use the sensor.</p>

<p>I'm currently programming in C# and the wrapper has worked so far.</p>

<p>Best of luck</p>
