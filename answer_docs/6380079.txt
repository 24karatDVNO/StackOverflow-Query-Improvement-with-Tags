<p>Okay, so I have got it partly solved...<br>
I used another table containing the one column which holds the subject of the PM. I also have a new column in the regular "pms" table that holds the same ID to be able to join the tables together.</p>

<p>However, when I select all the PMs to show them in the inbox, I have not found a way to group the conversations in order by if they're read or not. I'm currently using this SQL query:</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT * 
    FROM `pms` 
    JOIN `pm_conversations` ON (pms.ConvID = pm_conversations.ID) 
   WHERE pms.To='username' 
GROUP BY pm_conversations.ID 
ORDER BY pms.ID
</code></pre>

<p>I came up with this:</p>

<pre><code>   SELECT MAX(pms.ID) as pmIDS,
          pms.*,
          pm_conversations.* 
    FROM `pms` 
    JOIN `pm_conversations` ON (pms.ConvID = pm_conversations.ID)
   WHERE `To`='".$UserActive."' 
GROUP BY pm_conversations.ID 
ORDER BY pmIDS DESC
</code></pre>
