<p>The Google maps is probably getting confused by the fact that its creating and setting up itself and then you delete it and when its recreated it thinks it doesnt need to re-create itself due to variables still being in memory.</p>

<p>Try instead as a lot of people do is to put the map within a seperate iFrame.</p>
