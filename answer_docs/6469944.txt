<p>Makes sense. You should probably put channel editing in it's own settings view or modal view though. If users can edit channels on the "playing now" screen and that affects other tabs, Apple is likely to reject that on the App Store as it could be confusing, and kind of goes against their recommended use of the Tab Bar. If you put the editing of channels in a separate location, it's clear that it isn't specific to the tab they are looking at.</p>
