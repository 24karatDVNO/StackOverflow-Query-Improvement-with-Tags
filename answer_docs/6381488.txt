<p>The only possible way to do that is if you get a referrer back to a url like :</p>

<pre><code>facebook.com/profile.php?id=....
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can quite easily parse the url and get more information on the user. But if you do not have that information, it's not possible to do so.</p>

<p>It's quite easy to then parse the url using curl and reg matching.</p>
