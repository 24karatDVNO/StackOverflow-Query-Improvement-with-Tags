<p>Just to chime in with everyone else, I'd suggest you find yourself an article about BDD and test first development. And then read up on mocking and stubbing. Wrapping your head around the why and how of it will probably convince you it's worth the time and effort.</p>

<p>When I first dove into the XP &amp; RoR world I live in now I was daunted by what felt to me like test-mania but it really pays off in spades. </p>

<p>The first time someone had me write the test first THEN write the code we were testing I was mind blown. But I've never gone back to my previous evil ways.</p>
