<p>Your question doesn't have enough information to answer it.</p>

<ul>
<li>What URL are they on when they press the link?</li>
<li>What's the URL of the link itself (view source please)?</li>
<li>How did you generate the link?</li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that whatever you are using to generate the link is not taking into consideration the new route. So the link is generating some relative path "../../" which corresponds to the physical location, but it should be corresponding to the route.</p>
