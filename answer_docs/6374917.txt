<p>The following code creates a function <strong>Which_Line_for_Position(pos)</strong> that gives the <strong>number of the line</strong> for the position <strong>pos</strong>, that is to say the <em>number of line</em> in which lies the character situated  at  position <em>pos</em> in the file.</p>

<p>This function can be used with any position as argument, independantly from the value of the file's  pointer's current position and from the historic of the movements of this pointer before the function is called.</p>

<p>So, with this function, one isn't limited to determine the number of the current line only during an uninterrupted iteration on the lines, as it is the case with Greg Hewgill's solution.</p>

<pre><code>with open(filepath,'rb') as f:
    GIVE_NO_FOR_END = {}
    end = 0
    for i,line in enumerate(f):
        end += len(line)
        GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end] = i
    if line[-1]=='\n':
        GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end+1] = i+1
    end_positions = GIVE_NO_FOR_END.keys()
    end_positions.sort()

def Which_Line_for_Position(pos,
                            dic = GIVE_NO_FOR_END,
                            keys = end_positions,
                            kmax = end_positions[-1]):
    return dic[(k for k in keys if pos &lt; k).next()] if pos&lt;kmax else None
</code></pre>

<p>.</p>

<p>The same solution can be written with the help of the module <strong>fileinput</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>import fileinput

GIVE_NO_FOR_END = {}
end = 0
for line in fileinput.input(filepath,'rb'):
    end += len(line)
    GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end] = fileinput.filelineno()
if line[-1]=='\n':
    GIVE_NO_FOR_END[end+1] = fileinput.filelineno()+1
fileinput.close()

end_positions = GIVE_NO_FOR_END.keys()
end_positions.sort()

def Which_Line_for_Position(pos,
                            dic = GIVE_NO_FOR_END,
                            keys = end_positions,
                            kmax = end_positions[-1]):
    return dic[(k for k in keys if pos &lt; k).next()] if pos&lt;kmax else None
</code></pre>

<p>But this solution has some inconveniences: </p>

<ul>
<li>it needs to import the module <strong>fileinput</strong></li>
<li>it deletes all the content of the file !! There must be something wrong in my code but I don't know <strong>fileinput</strong> enough to find it. Or is it a normal behaviour of <strong>fileinput.input()</strong> function ?</li>
<li>it seems that the file is first entirely read before any iteration can be launched. If so, for a file very big, the size of the file may exceed the capacity of the RAM. I am not sure of this point: I tried to test with a file of 1,5 GB but it's rather long and I dropped this point for the moment. If this point is right, it constitutes an argument to use the other solution with <strong>enumerate()</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, having function <strong>Which_Line_for_Position()</strong> , it is easy to obtain the number of a current line : just passing <strong>f.tell()</strong> as argument to the function</p>

<p>But <strong>WARNING</strong>: when using <strong>f.tell()</strong> and doing movements of the file's pointer in the file, it is absolutely necessary that the file is opened in binary mode: <strong>'rb'</strong> or <strong>'rb+'</strong> or <strong>'ab'</strong> or ....</p>
