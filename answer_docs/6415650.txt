<p>Here you can set the size of popover using the following code:</p>

<pre><code>self.contentSizeForViewInPopover = CGSizeMake(320, 460);
</code></pre>

<p>You need to set the content size of popover in view using this code and you can add this code in the viewdidLoad mehtof of the controller. Let me know if you still have any question.</p>
