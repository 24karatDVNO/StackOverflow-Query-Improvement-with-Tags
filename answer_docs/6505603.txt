<p>Starting with StevieG's rewritten query, the values from stageComments are never used in the query - so it appears to be redundant - but will slow down the query significantly; the following should give the desired results much quicker:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT 
  R.ID,
  R.Title,
  R.Requirement_Text,
  R.Req_Owner,
  D.desname,
  D.team,
  D.stage,
  D.comm 
FROM Req R LEFT JOIN descomments D ON R.ID=D.id
WHERE 
  R.ProjectID='STE 11.2' 
ORDER BY R.Priority;
</code></pre>
