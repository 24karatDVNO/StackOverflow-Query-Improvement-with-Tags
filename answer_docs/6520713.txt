<p>The two samples are logically equivalent, provided that compound conditions are lazily evaluated, meaning that in <code>a &amp;&amp; b</code>, <code>b</code> won't be evaluated when <code>a</code> is known to be false. So even if there were a difference I wouldn't care because that might be an artefact (or a bug) of the compiler you're using, and it might change with the next release or bugfix.</p>
