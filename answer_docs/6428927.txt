<p>I wrote <a href="http://wjlafrance.net/?p=188" rel="nofollow">a blog post</a> about an issue like this a few weeks ago. You need an iPhone 3G. The unstated and unwritten rule of iOS target selection is "if you didn't test it on one, you don't support it, so don't pretend to." iPhone 3G's are dropping price, so you can get one on eBay / Craigslist at a reasonable price.</p>
