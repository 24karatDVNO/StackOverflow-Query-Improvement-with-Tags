<p>It uses the Google directions API but you still get the data you require, and uses Lat/Lon for the request. You would also need to add:</p>

<pre><code>JSONObject duration = steps.getJSONObject("duration");

        String sDuration = duration.getString("text");
        int iDuration = duration.getInt("value");
</code></pre>

<p>in order to get the duration, make sure you put it after JSONObject steps = legs.getJSONObject(0);</p>
