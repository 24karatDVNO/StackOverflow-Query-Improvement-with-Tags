<p>You can also use XPath syntax.</p>

<p>here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>string inputArtist = "Pink Floyd";
var doc = XDocument.Load("test.xml");
XmlNode cdTitleNode = doc.SelectSingleNode("//cd[artist='" + inputArtist + "']/title");

string outputTitle = cdTitleNode.InnerText;
</code></pre>

<p>There is an excellent XPATH simulator on <a href="http://www.whitebeam.org/library/guide/TechNotes/xpathtestbed.rhtm" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitebeam.org/library/guide/TechNotes/xpathtestbed.rhtm</a> to try you Xpath expressions. </p>

<p>You can also found a good tutorial there, but a fast search on the web will result in many web pages explaining all about XPath usage and syntax.</p>
