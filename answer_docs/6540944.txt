<p>Your error messages are not useful because of incorrect settings.</p>

<ul>
<li>While debugging your code (on a development server), try using <code>DEBUG=True</code> and check the error messages.</li>
<li>On a production server, you should <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/views/#the-500-server-error-view" rel="nofollow">add a 500.html page to your templates</a>.  Following this, you might receive better error messages in your log files.

<p>(Since you should get a very different error message,  please post your problem with the new error message again in a new question instead of updating this one.  Thanks.)</p>
