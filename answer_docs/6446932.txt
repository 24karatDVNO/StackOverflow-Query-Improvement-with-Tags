<p>The C# code above is a if-then structure.  I don't have the code in front of me, but the line is essentially shorthand for:</p>

<pre><code>If (publishIEvent == true)
{
   var eventMessage = Bus.CreateInstance&lt;IEvent&gt;()
}
else
{
   var eventMessage = new EventMessage();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps solve the issue.</p>

<p>FYI, I realize the code above is not syntactically correct, just trying to illustrate the point of the C# statement.</p>
