<p>There's two ways as far as I can see:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Try to find a contact module and deactivate it.</p></li>
<li><p>If that doesn't work, do a search on a word from the contact you're trying to hide, find the file it's in and modify it. You can use the windows search but you'd have to copy the all the files locally.</p></li>
</ol>
