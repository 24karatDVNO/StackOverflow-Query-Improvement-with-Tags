<p>I tried below and it worked for me (in ksh) not sure why it would error out in your case</p>

<pre><code>user="username";
host="somehost";
VFSTAB_LOC="result.out";
DEST="/home/username/aaa.out";
echo $DEST;
`ssh $user@$host "grep '/abc/dyf' $VFSTAB_LOC | awk '{print $3, $1}'" &gt;&gt; $DEST`;
</code></pre>
