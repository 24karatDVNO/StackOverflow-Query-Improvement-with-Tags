<p>As I added to my question, the root of the problem was not with depth textures or blend mode, but just that I was rendering into a buffer with 8 bits per color component.  It probably would work if I went out of my way to get a higher-precision color buffer.  But I went for the alternative of using a fragment program that puts the output in <code>gl_FragDepth</code>, and that seems to work as desired, since I already had a 24-bit depth buffer.</p>
