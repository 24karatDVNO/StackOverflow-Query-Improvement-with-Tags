<p>One of the primary reasons for having an exceptions framework is so that if the code ever gets to the point where it cannot proceed, it has the ability to tell the surrounding context that something has gone wrong. It means that if I have a class <code>Foo</code> which needs to have <code>$fooInstance-&gt;setBarHandler($barHandler)</code> called before <code>$fooInstance-&gt;doFoo();</code> can succeed, the class can provide a message to the greater context instead of failing silently and returning <code>FALSE</code>. Further, it allows the context to say, "Huh. That broke. Well, I can now tell the user/logs/something else that something bad happened, and I can decide whether I need to keep on chugging."</p>
