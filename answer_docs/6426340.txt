<p>You should be able to center any div by giving it an absolute position with a left value of 50% and a left marginal pixel value of negative half the pixel dimension of the width of the div.  </p>

<p>So If you had a div with a width of say 955 px, to center it you would give it an absolute position with a left value of 50% and a left marginal value of -477.5, and it should stay centered regardless.  </p>

<p>As for the horizontal scroll bar, you should set the pixel dimension of the body to 100% for both width and height, that way your page will resize to the users resolution.</p>
