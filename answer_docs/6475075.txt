<p>Make sure that the service name in the server configuration file matches the <strong>fully-qualified name</strong> of the service - the name attribute in the <code>&lt;system.serviceModel/services/service&gt;</code> element. If it doesn't match, then WCF will provide a default endpoint whose binding is basicHttpBinding (and the content-type it expects is different than the one the client is sending).</p>
