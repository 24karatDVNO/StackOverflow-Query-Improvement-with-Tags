<p>Are you sure that you want to encrypt (StartTLS) the connection to the mail server? I would contact someone who knows the insides of that server to see what protocol/encryption to use.</p>

<p>You say that upon removing the call to <code>server.starttls()</code>, you get a different series of error messages. Could you please post those messages as well? </p>

<p>Also, you might want to read up on StartTLS so you understand what it is and why you would want to use it. It seems you're writing a Serious Business program, in which case you'll probably want to understand what you are doing, security-wise.</p>
