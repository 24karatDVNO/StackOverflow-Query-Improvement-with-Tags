<p>The problem was down to the POCO class Key annotation being on a non-unique field. I have changed it around to the unique Month property and it now works as expected.</p>

<p>Strange error though...</p>

<pre><code>Imports System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
Imports System.Runtime.Serialization

Public Class EngineeringHeadBUHistory

    '&lt;Key()&gt;
    '&lt;DataMember()&gt; _
    'Property BusinessUnit As String
    &lt;Key()&gt;
    &lt;DataMember()&gt;
    Property Month As Date
    &lt;DataMember()&gt; _
    Property HeadCount As Integer

End Class
