<p>cron is a mechanism for executing a script (or executable) at a regular time. The script can be written in any script language, so pick one you are familiar with. Shell script (e.g. bash) is often used, but you could use perl, python, PHP etc.</p>

<p>The wikipedia page has information about the cron format for specifying when the script will run: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron</a></p>

<p>Your ISP may provide easy access via a control panel, or you may have to request them to setup the cron job. You'll need to find out from them exactly how to set it up.</p>
