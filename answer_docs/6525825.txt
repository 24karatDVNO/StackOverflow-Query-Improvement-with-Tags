<p>There are a couple of approaches you can take here, personally I would replace the default event handler for the TextChanged event via inheritance.</p>

<p>The code assigns one via during the setup and unfortunately textbox is a private member</p>

<pre><code>textBox.TextChanged += new EventHandler(OnSelectedDateChanged);  
</code></pre>

<p>which is declared as </p>

<pre><code>protected virtual void OnSelectedDateChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
</code></pre>

<p>So we can inherit SlimeeLibrary.DatePicker</p>

<pre><code>public class EnhancedDatePicker : SlimeeLibrary.DatePicker
</code></pre>

<p>and then override the EventHandler raising a new parse error event.</p>

<p>public event EventHandler OnDateParseError;</p>

<pre><code>protected override void OnSelectedDateChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    try
    {
        base.OnSelectedDateChanged(sender, e);
    }
    catch (FormatException fe)
    {            
        OnDateParseError(sender, e);
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps.  I haven't checked it but have examined the code for slimees control, but don't want to setup a code project account to download it sorry.  You'll obviously need to change your ASP.NET usercontrol references to use the new class.</p>
