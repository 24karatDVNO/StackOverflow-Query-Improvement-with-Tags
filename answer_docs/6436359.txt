<p>You could use:</p>

<pre><code>+ (void)animateWithDuration:(NSTimeInterval)duration delay:(NSTimeInterval)delay 
options:(UIViewAnimationOptions)options animations:(void (^)(void))animations 
completion:(void (^)(BOOL finished))completion
</code></pre>

<p>And use the Ease in and Ease out transitions to accelerate and decelerate toward the end.</p>

<p>Note: the blocks based animation is only valid in is 4.0 and later if you want earlier you need to use</p>

<pre><code>+ (void)beginAnimations:(NSString *)animationID context:(void *)context
</code></pre>

<p>And its a simple matter of editing the frame of the view.</p>
