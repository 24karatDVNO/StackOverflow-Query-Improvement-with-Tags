<p>Remember that you're still dealing in web requests/responses.  A browser sends a request to your web server, the web server builds a response and sends it back to the browser.  Each request/response pair are independent of the others: once the response is sent to the browser, the web server disposes of all server resources used to fill the request.  Network traffic is relatively slow, so by the time <em>any</em> javascript code runs, your server-side page object is already long gone.  It just doesn't exist any more.</p>

<p>ASP.Net webforms goes to a lot of effort via viewstate to hide all this from you, but that's still the way it is.  If you want to call to server-side VB.Net code and you don't want to use a normal postback, you can do that via ajax (webmethod).  The trick is that you have to write the code to send and response to any information you require, because you've thrown all the helps built in by asp.net out the window.  </p>

<p>The other option here is to use javascript to trigger a postback.  That is relatively easy: you can do it by just calling the <a href="http://wiki.asp.net/page.aspx/1082/dopostback-function/" rel="nofollow"><code>__doPostBack()</code></a> function.  The hard part is that you're not actually connected to a server event, so you'll need code in your page load to detect your specific request and react appropriately.</p>
