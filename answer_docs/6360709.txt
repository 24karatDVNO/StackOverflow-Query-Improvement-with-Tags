<p>You want to force the user of an Order to remember to complete it, is that it? If it is the user's choice when to call Complete() then that's gonna be hard. I guess that you either want the complete to be automatically done after something else that is done with the order <em>or</em> you have to somehow make sure that it will be obvious to the user that he forgot to complete it.</p>

<p>It is hard to know without more details of what an order is and how it is used.</p>
