<p>Instead of</p>

<pre><code>self.dataSource = [TTListDataSource
                   dataSourceWithItems:tableItems.items];
</code></pre>

<p>why don't you just do this?</p>

<pre><code>self.dataSource = tableItems;
</code></pre>

<p>You may also want to look into creating a model to go with your dataSource - that is, a class that extends TTModel (or TTURLRequestModel, since you're making a URL request).</p>
