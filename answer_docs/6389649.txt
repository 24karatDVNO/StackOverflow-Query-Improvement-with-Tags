<p>I believe you can also write to: File.applicationStorageDirectory</p>

<p>You could embed the asset:</p>

<pre><code>[Embed(source="assets/file.png")]
private var _class:Class;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, I'm unsure if you want a Spark Image component for iOS.  Flex Mobile projects are currently not supported by iOS, I believe.</p>
