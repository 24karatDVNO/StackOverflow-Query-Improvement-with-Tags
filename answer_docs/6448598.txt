<p>Without more info it's hard to say, but my initial reaction is that you may not be passing the user variable to the template context in your view function.</p>

<p>i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>def view(request):
    t = loader.get_template('index.html')
    c = Context({"user": request.user})
    return HttpResponse(t.render(c))
</code></pre>
