<p>I've managed to do this using jQuery + Javascript.</p>

<p>Basically I created an HTML ImageMap and on every region I added a listener on the mouseover, mouseout, click events. In the handlers, the Javascript code worked perfectly.</p>

<p>I embedded the page with the ImageMap in an iFrame into the SharePoint webpart that I needed.</p>
