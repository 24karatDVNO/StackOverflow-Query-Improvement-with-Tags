<p>I've personally used </p>

<ul>
<li>Apache Wicket</li>
<li>Spring MVC + JSP</li>
<li>JSF</li>
<li>GWT</li>
</ul>

<p>and for a webapplication which is not high frequently visited I recommend</p>

<ul>
<li>Apache Wicket </li>
</ul>

<p>the most. </p>

<p>It has the clearest event based component and model approach and the lowest impact on the html templates I've seen till today.</p>
