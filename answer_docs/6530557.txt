<p>Using <code>lineToPoint</code> will just create straight zigzaggy lines, even as part of a bezier path. If by "smooth" you mean "curvy", then you should probably check out <code>curveToPoint</code> instead. Also, note that these "toPoint" methods already move the point, no need to <code>moveToPoint</code> unless you intend to move to a different point than where your line ended.</p>
