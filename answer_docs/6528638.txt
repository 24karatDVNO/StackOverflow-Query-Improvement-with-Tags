<p>A django form (but other objects, too) has a <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/forms.py#L94" rel="nofollow"><code>unicode</code></a> method, which is invoked, when a string representation of the object is requested. As you can see in the code, it just passes the call on to <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/forms.py#L210" rel="nofollow"><code>as_table</code></a> - which in turn uses a generic helper function: <a href="https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/forms/forms.py#L138" rel="nofollow"><code>_html_output</code></a>. This basically loops over all the fields and constructs the HTML which then is returned and displayed on the page.</p>
