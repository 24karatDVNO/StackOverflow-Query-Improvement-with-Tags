<p>To achieve a consistent result like </p>

<pre><code>Employer
    job posting 1
    job posting 2
Other employer
    job posting 1
</code></pre>

<p>You might have to alter you query to sort your jobs by employer first to be sure that the jobs are grouped together.</p>

<p>Then by looping through your data (untested pseudo-code)</p>

<pre><code>employerCache = '';
for ($jobs as $job) {
   if ($job['company_name'] != employerCache) {
       // display company/employer header
       $employerCache = $job['company_name'];
   }
   // display job posting
}
</code></pre>

<p>That will give you 1 loop instead of two nested loops on the same dataset</p>
