<p>Personally I include it just to be sure that I'm covering everything, but honestly I don't think it ever gets used. I wouldn't worry about it if you don't want to, but I try and be as cross-browser compatible as I can. You can also use something like Curvey Corners (google it) which (I think) just lets you put <code>border-radius</code> and does all the other stuff for you using JS, and on top of that, adds support for border-radius to browsers that don't natively support it. There are similar things out there for other CSS3 stuff, but that's really the only one I use.</p>

<p>I just can't wait for CSS3 to be widespread so we can use it without having to worry about all these useless prefixes.</p>
