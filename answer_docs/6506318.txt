<p>If you have an index on <code>ut</code>, this may benefit from the index:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE ut &lt;= TIMESTAMPDIFF(MINUTE, lastcheck, NOW())
</code></pre>

<p>If you have an index on <code>lastcheck</code>, this may benefit from the index:</p>

<pre><code>WHERE (NOW() - INTERVAL ut MINUTE) &gt;= lastcheck
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Thinking more clearly, I don't think any of the two versions can beneficially use any index at all.</p>

<p>The second perhaps (if the distinct values in <code>ut</code> are few compared to the rows of the table) would benefit from a JOIN to an auxilary table.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT t.*
FROM table t
  JOIN 
    ( SELECT 
          ut 
        , (NOW() - INTERVAL ut MINUTE) AS nowMinusInterval 
      FROM table
      GROUP BY ut
    ) AS dt
  ON t.ut = dt.ut
WHERE dt.nowMinusInterval &gt;= t.lastcheck
</code></pre>
