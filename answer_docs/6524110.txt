<p>I use CR and only found out you can't control the colors used, which sucks, big time.</p>

<p>So where i could i extracted the colors from a generated report and used custom boxes with those colors. Ofcourse that doesn't work if the amount of columns are variable.</p>

<p>If you're lucky CR uses the same colors everytime so you could maybe generate a report with the maximum columns and use those colors programmatically.</p>

<p>If anyone has a better solution i sure love to hear it.</p>
