<p>Eclipse keeps metadata about all files within every eclipse project. "Resource is out of sync with the file system..." means that eclipse has noticed that a file has been changed (or deleted) from outside eclipse. Refreshing the project in question (from the context menu in the package explorer) should fix the problem.</p>
