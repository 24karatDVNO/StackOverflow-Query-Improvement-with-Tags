<p>If you have ADB installed (as I assume you do), you just connect your phone to your computer via USB, enable debugging mode, and type in:</p>

<pre><code>adb -d logcat
</code></pre>

<p>from the command line on your computer. A lot of output will show up, and you can scroll through to find the output you are looking for.</p>

<p>You can also show only specific tags, such as <code>FOOBAR</code>:</p>

<pre><code>adb -d logcat -s FOOBAR
</code></pre>

<p>By using this command, you can filter out only uncaught exceptions, which is useful for debugging:</p>

<pre><code>adb -d logcat -s AndroidRuntime:E
</code></pre>
