<p>One thing you could look into instead of a file is <a href="http://memcached.org/" rel="nofollow">Memcached</a> and delete the file once you are done decrypting it.</p>

<p>Also, you could just store the encrypted file in a db as a blob and retrieve it as a stream. Then you should be able to decrypt it on the fly.</p>
