<p>As a totally different approach, you could take a look at the Fluent Validation project <a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/</a> which plays well with MVC via an inversion of control container <a href="http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=mvc&amp;referringTitle=Documentation" rel="nofollow">http://fluentvalidation.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=mvc&amp;referringTitle=Documentation</a> and <a href="http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2010/02/22/using-fluentvalidation-with-an-ioc-container/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jeremyskinner.co.uk/2010/02/22/using-fluentvalidation-with-an-ioc-container/</a></p>

<p>This should enable you to code this and similar rules really well, and the IOC articles show how to integrate into MVC&lt;3</p>

<p>(not strictly an answer as you stated MVC2 but an upgrade to MVC3 would make this easier too as it supports model level validation <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3#BM_Model_Validation_Improvements" rel="nofollow">http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3#BM_Model_Validation_Improvements</a> )</p>
