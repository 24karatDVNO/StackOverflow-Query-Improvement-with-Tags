<p>If you'd like to set up a web service that returns JSON, the <a href="http://www.web2py.com" rel="nofollow">web2py</a> framework makes that very easy (see <a href="http://web2py.com/book/default/chapter/09" rel="nofollow">here</a>). It also runs out-of-the-box on Google App Engine -- you can even deploy to GAE directly from web2py's web-based IDE (<a href="http://www.web2py.com/demo_admin/gae/deploy" rel="nofollow">demo</a>). If you have any questions, you'll get lots of help from the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/web2py" rel="nofollow">mailing list</a>.</p>
