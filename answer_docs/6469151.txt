<p>You didn't mention which version of prototype you are running. I ran into a similar problem that may be similar on one of my pages using prototype 1.5.0 (please don't judge). In 1.5.0 the setStyle and getStyle functions do a browser check for IE specifically when dealing with opacity/alpha(opacity).</p>

<pre><code>/MSIE/.test(navigator.userAgent)
</code></pre>

<p>In my case, setStyle calls getStyle('filter').replace(). Unfortunately getStyle('filter') returns null with IE9 so .replace throws an exception.</p>
