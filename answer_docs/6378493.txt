<p>Microsoft officially introduced a multiprocessor built option in VS2008. It will allow the build to start multiple compilers for the same project. The easy solution is just upgrade to the latest version of Visual Studio.</p>

<p>If you are stuck on VS2005, then it is actually available there as well, but not officially supported. Just add /MP as an additional compiler option. </p>
