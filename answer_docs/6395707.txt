<p>You should do something like this</p>

<pre><code>operator Class2() const 
{
    Class2 tmp;
    ...
    return tmp;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then if you have something like this</p>

<pre><code>Class1 c1;
Class2 c2 = c1;
</code></pre>

<p>the memory for <code>tmp</code> will be allocated in stack, then a copy constructor of <code>Class2</code> would be called to copy <code>tmp</code> to <code>c2</code>, and then the destructor of <code>tmp</code> would be called as it is an automatic variable.</p>
