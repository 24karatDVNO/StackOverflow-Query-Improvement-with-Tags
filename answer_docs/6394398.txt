<p>Unfortunately the JavaScript <code>confirm</code> function does not give you any control over the title, icon or any other aspects of the dialog. If you want a custom dialog I'd suggest you instead show a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that looks a bit like a dialog. It can then look however you want it to look. <a href="http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/" rel="nofollow">jQuery UI Dialog</a> may be helpful.</p>
