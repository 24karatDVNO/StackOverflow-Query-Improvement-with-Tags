<p>When you do COM programming, you are in general very defensive. So, as a caller, you use the famous FAILED or SUCCEEDED macros (or equivalent in the language used) when calling functions of an interface.</p>

<p>However, when the documentation stipulates that the result is not important, it is recommended not to check the result. So, as a caller, I would do</p>

<pre><code>...
myObject.SetSite(whatever);
...
</code></pre>

<p>instead of</p>

<pre><code>...
if (FAILED(myObject.SetSite(whatever))) goto error;
...
</code></pre>

<p>Note this is quite specific because SetSite is documented like this.</p>

<p>If I don't read the doc carefully (as you did) and assume this is a "regular hresult return" interface call, I would use the FAILED macro. If you return anything undocumented, FAILED will catch it anyway, and I'm quite safe anyway.</p>
