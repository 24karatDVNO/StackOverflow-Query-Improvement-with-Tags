<p>About i++ (post-incrementation) vs. ++i (pre-incrementation) @me: "In both cases, the expression gets evaluated, and the result is used to check against the condition. In the pre-increment case, the increment expression increments the variable and returns the resulting value. For post-increment, the increment expression also increments the variable, but it returns the previous value. As a result, pre-increment compares against the incremented value, whereas post-increment compares against the original value; in both cases, the variable has been incremented when the condition is checked." â€“ tdammers</p>
