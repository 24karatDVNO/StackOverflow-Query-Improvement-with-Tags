<p>What's your priority? Do you want it to have the difference between height, width to be minimum, or anything like that? </p>

<p>Given the number n of images. You should take every number i from 1 to sqrt(n). If n can be divided by i (n%i ==0), divide and increment an array power[i] each time it divides. If n cannot be divided any more by i (aka n%i != 0) increment i else divide again.</p>

<p>You should get all the divisors and their biggest power in a given number n.</p>

<p>Make combinations of these and you will get the dimensions of your square. </p>
