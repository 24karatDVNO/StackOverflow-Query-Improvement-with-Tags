<p>Can you ping the service with curl and your credentials?</p>

<p>I always start debugging these kinds of things from the command line and ignore the code.</p>

<p>If you can get there from curl then you know it's in your software, otherwise you can work out what is wrong with your credentials.</p>

<p>500 is a real fail, not credentials - is there anything in the server logs at the Oracle CRM end?</p>
