<p>You can use JavaScript to hide the image after a given amount of time using the <code>setTimeout</code> function. When the given amount of time has passed, you can change the style of the required image to <code>display:none</code>.</p>

<p>As the images can be displayed for different amounts of time, I would suggest giving each image a unique <code>id</code> (perhaps they already have a unique ID in your database table) which can then be used to identify that image in your JavaScript.</p>
