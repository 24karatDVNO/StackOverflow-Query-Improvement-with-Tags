<p>The closest answer I found here was along the lines of the accepted answer for a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6191005/nhibernate-alternate-ids-using-generated-properties">related post</a>.</p>

<p>That posting is much more NHibernate specific than I'd like, so this is a half-hearted answer. Love to see a more technology agnostic (ie, design pattern) type of answer.</p>

<p>Cheers,<br>
