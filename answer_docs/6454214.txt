<p>For that usage the return statement must be of the same type. In your case this it's not. I would test if the user exists and and then decide wether to return an error code or message in the service or the registration. And make a boolean out of your test variable.</p>

<pre><code>ResponseObject o;//wether SOAP, RPC-XML, JSON, XML

if(ExistLogin(login)/*must return boolean*/)
{
    o = createExistAnswerForService(login);
}
else
{
    o = createUserAddedAnswerForService(login, name, password);
}
return o;
</code></pre>

<p>In the response you can give the user information if the call was successful or not. I won't create an error class since it is no error but a validation fault. Always use error to catch them not to communicate with the user. Otherwise code will be confusing to others.</p>
