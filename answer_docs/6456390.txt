<p>The points on customer portal are correct, and you have to pay for these licences. If you build your own auth on Force.com Sites and salesforce.com finds out they'll be very unhappy. That said you can still do it using cookies (http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/apexcode/Content/apex_classes_sites_cookie.htm) but it's not perfect because it's client-side.</p>

<p>I highly recommend that you steer clear of this approach though. You're better off building your UI layer on another platform (Google App Engine or Heroku) and using web services created on the Force.com platform through that UI.</p>
