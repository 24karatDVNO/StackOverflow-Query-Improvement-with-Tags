<p>Looks like the original xalan has a similiar implementation - at least I found the same lines for xalan 2.7.1 at <a href="http://grepcode.com/file/repository.jboss.org/maven2/xalan/xalan/2.7.1/org/apache/xml/serializer/Version.java" rel="nofollow">grepcode</a></p>

<p>It really doesn't make any sense, to much effort for a method that always returns <code>0</code> ;) But from looking at the javaDoc of <code>Version</code> and this method I get the impression that all of this is (or was) work in progress - some sort of implementation stub where one can simply enter (hardcode) a version number. For now, the else block and the catch block are <em>unreachable code</em>.</p>

<p>Maybe <code>Version.java</code> is/will be autogenerated and the processor may generate this method with a real value instead of <code>""</code> - in that case it would make sense to secure the method, as the value from the config file may not represent an integer.</p>
