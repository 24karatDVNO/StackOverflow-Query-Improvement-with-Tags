<p>What you need is the CSS selector <code>nth-of-type()</code>. This would allow you to specify, say, the third matching element in a set, or any other arbitrary numbered position.</p>

<p>However, strangely, JQuery doesn't support this selctor -- it supports virtually every other selector known to man, and a few others besides, but not this one.</p>

<p>The good news, however, is that there is a JQuery plug-in called <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/moreSelectors" rel="nofollow">More Selectors</a> which adds this selector to JQuery, along with a few others.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
