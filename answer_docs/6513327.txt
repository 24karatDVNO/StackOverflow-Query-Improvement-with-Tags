<p>For libraries that are required only in a single project, the best practice is to add them to the Project's PYTHONPATH and not the SYSTEM PYTHONPATH.</p>

<p>This is done by right clicking on the project -> Properties -> PyDev-PYTHONPATH -> External Libraries and then adding the required library using Add zip/jar/egg.</p>
