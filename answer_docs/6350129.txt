<p>For the record, I'm having the same problem. Have you found a solution?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
I have managed to nail it down to the two if-statements below. If I comment out either of the if-statements, Proguard succeeds and does not throw the <code>NullPointerException</code>. </p>

<pre><code>boolean externalStorageAvailable = false;
boolean externalStorageWriteable = false;
...
if (!externalStorageAvailable) {
    throw new IOException("External storage is not available");
}
if (!externalStorageWriteable) {
    throw new IOException("Could not get write access to external storage");
}
</code></pre>

<p>And if I invert and the boolean values and assign them to new variables, Proguard also succeeds. That works for me.</p>

<pre><code>boolean externalStorageAvailable = false;
boolean externalStorageWriteable = false;
...
boolean notAvailable = !externalStorageAvailable;
boolean notWritable = !externalStorageWriteable;
if (notAvailable) {
    throw new IOException("External storage is not available");
}
if (notWritable) {          
    throw new IOException("Could not get write access to external storage");
}
</code></pre>
