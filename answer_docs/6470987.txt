<p>While not an HTML editor, there is an option in GIMP to slice an image, and export it as an HTML table, with onmouseover effects for basica animation. You have to have GIMP-Python installed (authomatic on Linux, but requires some steps on Windows) -- then check for the filters->web->pyslice.    It can save some time in design for menu areas and such.</p>

<p>To create the whole page, however, you have to edit HTML by hand.</p>
