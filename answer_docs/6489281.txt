<p>Apart from that, I think this is probably a design issue you need to address, but I'm not sure. I normally fetch all the data I need, then a single unidirectional pass through the dataset is usually enough. If necessary, make a second pass (rarely), but I've never had to move back and forth several times within a dataset. There is probably a better way. Hope that helps.</p>
