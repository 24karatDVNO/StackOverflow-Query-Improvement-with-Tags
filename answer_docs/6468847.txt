<p>Even at runtime, the behaviour of this code is undefined.  If you want deterministic behaviour (in the form of an exception to flag the error) on vector bound misuse, you need to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/c6kkh778.aspx" rel="nofollow">vector::at()</a> instead of <code>vector::operator[]</code>.</p>
