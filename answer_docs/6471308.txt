<p>If your send action is completing so quickly that the dialog is not displaying properly, might I suggest instead using an indeterminate progress bar in the upper right corner of your activity via <code>requestWindowFeature(Window.FEATURE_INDETERMINATE_PROGRESS)</code> and then utilizing <code>setProgressBarIndeterminateVisibility(true/false)</code>.</p>
