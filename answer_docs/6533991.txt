<p>I guess you could do something along the lines of (untested):</p>

<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT
    *
FROM (
    SELECT
        id, comment, time
    FROM
        table
    ORDER BY
        time DESC
    LIMIT 5
)
ORDER BY
    time ASC
</code></pre>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong><br>
Apparently, the "derived table must have its own alias" (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mysql-error-1248?sort=newest">error #1248</a>). Other answers have already done this, so I'll jump on the bandwagon. Below you'll find the revised (and tested) query:</p>

<pre class="lang-sql prettyprint-override"><code>SELECT
    derived.*
FROM (
    SELECT
        id, comment, time
    FROM
        table
    ORDER BY
        time DESC
    LIMIT 5
) AS derived
ORDER BY
    derived.time ASC
</code></pre>
