<p>While I suspect Keoki has it correct, another possible problem could be the font. If using a special character where your friend's font doesn't contain that character, they'll just see the missing character sign. In the webpage or whatever medium you are using to post the character, be sure that a font is set, as there's no guarentees on the default font working. </p>

<p>If neither of these be the case though, what is an example character that isn't showing up? Can you post the full code you are using?</p>
