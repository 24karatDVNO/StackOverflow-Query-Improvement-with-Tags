<p>The account under which an asp.net application runs, has very limited permissions by default. You need to configure the permissions to run an application on the server.
Read this Microsoft support link - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555134" rel="nofollow">Unable to Start a Process from ASP.NET</a>.
You may also Google on how to set ASP.NET account permissions depending on the IIS version that you are using.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
