<p>In C++ the only difference between a <code>class</code> and a <code>struct</code> is that class-members are private by default, while <code>struct</code>-members default to public. So structures can have constructors, and the syntax is the same as for classes. But only if you do not have your structure in a union.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

<pre><code>struct TestStruct {
        int id;
        TestStruct() : id(42)
        {
        }
};
</code></pre>
