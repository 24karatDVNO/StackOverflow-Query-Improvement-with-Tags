<p>I tested the script and the example and found that it can not loop back to image 1 with effect slide towards to the left. Because the images were queued from left to right as 1-2-3-4-5-6-7, whenever it slide from image 7 to 1, it must turn back to the image 1 position (CSS <code>left:6000px</code> to <code>left:0px</code>). If you want the transition effect slide towards to the left, there will have an image like as image 1 and stand right next to the image 7. The position of images will be 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-1 and this code can not do it for you.</p>

<p>I suggest you use jquery plugin slider <a href="http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/index.php#demo" rel="nofollow">jCarousel Lite </a>.It is simple to use with many awesome configurations and <code>circular</code> is exactly config which you need. Hope you found this useful. Regards.</p>
