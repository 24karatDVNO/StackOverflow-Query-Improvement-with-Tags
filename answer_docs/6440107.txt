<p>I'm a fan of <a href="http://www.plupload.com/" rel="nofollow">plupload</a> which support a wide variety of client technologies (html5, flash, silverlight, browserplus, gears) in addition to basic single file html4 upload, unlike SWFUpload which only does flash + html4 fallback.</p>

<p>It also integrates nicely with jQuery.</p>
