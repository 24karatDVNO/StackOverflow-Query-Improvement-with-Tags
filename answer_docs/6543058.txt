<p>What was happening is i was using brew and it was installing v 1.0.0 where clipRect and almost every other function wasn't supported as v 1.0.0 is the oldest version.</p>

<p>If you follow these instructions: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/BuildInstructions#Mac_OS_X" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/BuildInstructions#Mac_OS_X</a></p>

<p>then right click on the complied file and click show/view contents (on mac) then copy the executable bin/phantomjs.app/Contents/MacOS/phantomjs to some directory in your PATH.</p>

<p>Feel free to post on here i'm monitoring this and i can help if needed.</p>
