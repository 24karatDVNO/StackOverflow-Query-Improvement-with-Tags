<p>You store the reservation as a desired (or target) time, and the amount of time they are staying as a time offset (most likely in hours).</p>

<p>So the desired check-in time will be 19/06/2011, 13:00 hours. The offset for the time i'm staying is 24 (for 24 hours, it could be 25 if i've requested a late checkout).</p>

<p>In your system these times should always be recognised as guidelines - i may not turn up at 1pm (i could be several hours late), that time is simply a guideline for the hotel to have the room ready. I may turn up at 12pm but the hotel doesn't have the room ready till 3pm.</p>

<p>So through all this, the server time should have very little impact on anything. If the server is triggering notifications then you may get a notification early or late, but in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter too much because you will notice the problem quickly and staff should be capable of accomodating the problem until it's fixed.</p>
