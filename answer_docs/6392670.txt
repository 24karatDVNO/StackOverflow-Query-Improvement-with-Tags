<p>I've just been doing something similar, and came across your question.</p>

<p>In my case, I thought that minidom.parse was broken because I was getting syntax errors.  It turns out the syntax errors were in my xml document though - the trace didn't make that very clear.</p>

<p>If you're getting syntax errors with minidom.parse or minidom.parseString, make sure to check your source file.</p>
