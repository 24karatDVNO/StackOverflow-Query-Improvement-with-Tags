<p>I found that I can just overwrite them with null or delete them:</p>

<pre><code>runCommand = null;
delete runCommand;
</code></pre>

<p>I can find out which global functions and objects there are by <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2257993/how-to-display-all-methods-in-a-javascript-object/2946616#2946616">getting all properties</a> of the Global, which is stored in <code>this</code>:</p>

<pre><code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(this);
</code></pre>
