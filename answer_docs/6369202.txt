<p>The question which you are asking is not a chicken and egg situation. Its more like hows the language compiler is implemented. Like C# and VB.NET compiler are implemented differently.If you write a simple code of hello world and compile it with both the compiler and inspect the IL code they will be different. Coming back to your question, I will like to explain what IL code is generated by C# compiler for <code>IEnumerable</code>.</p>

<pre><code>IEnumerator e = arr.GetEnumerator();

while(e.MoveNext())
{
   e.Currrent;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So the C# compiler is tweaked for the case of <code>foreach</code>. </p>
