<p>I would suggest configure AzMan to use ADAM (Active Directory Application Mode).  This way you can have own database (AD) of external users with your defined roles, and AzMan will call that ADAM to check user roles.  I've done it and it works fine.  Here is the link for how to implement it: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff647400.aspx" rel="nofollow">How To: Use ADAM for Roles in ASP.NET 2.0</a></p>
