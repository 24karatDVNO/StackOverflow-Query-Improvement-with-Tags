<p>With an all-zeros array, you could start with [row,col] = [0,0], fill in this space, then add [0,1] to position (one to the right) until it's at the end or runs into a non-zero.</p>

<p>Then go down (add [1,0]), filling in space until it's the end or runs into a non-zero.</p>

<p>Then go left (add [0,-1]), filling in space until it's the end or runs into a non-zero.</p>

<p>Then go up (add [-1,0]), filling in space until it's the end or runs into a non-zero.</p>

<p>and repeat...</p>
