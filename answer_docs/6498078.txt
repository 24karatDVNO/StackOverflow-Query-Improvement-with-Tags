<p>It'll depend somewhat on what db you're using, but this outta work in PostgreSQL:</p>

<pre><code>    SELECT d.id , p.count, c.count, AVG(I.rating)
      FROM tbl_item d
      JOIN ( SELECT count(id), item_id as id from tbl_purchases ) as P
     USING (id)
      JOIN ( SELECT count(id), item_id as id from tbl_comment ) as C
     USING (id)
 LEFT JOIN tbl_rating as I
        ON tbl_rating.id = d.id
  GROUP BY d.id
;
</code></pre>
