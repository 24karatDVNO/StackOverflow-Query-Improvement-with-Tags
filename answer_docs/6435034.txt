<p>Same thing happened to me as was happening to Alun ap Rhisiart</p>

<p>My problem was for the second line in this block...</p>

<pre><code>def sign_in(user)
  cookies.permanent.signed[:remember_token] = [user.id, user.salt]
  self.current_user = user
  logger.debug "sign_in(user) - #{self.current_user}"
end
</code></pre>

<p>...I had accidentally put [user.id], [user.salt]</p>
