<p>After initial page load, that bit of javascript is never processed again. It only sets the header once, which it does successfully. Afterwards, you'll have to manually update the h1:</p>

<pre><code>$.get("ajax/siteInfo.php?id=" + getURLvar( 'id' ), function(siteData){
    $('div[data-role="header"] h1').html(siteData.siteTitle);
}, "json");
</code></pre>
