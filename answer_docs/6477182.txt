<p>ok i figuered it out. when i brougth my project over to linux tomcat expects to see all the java classes, flex config files and web.xml file under the root/web-inf. I wish i can change that but thats just the way it works. I was hoping with blazeds i can just put my files on a server and it would all work but thats not the case so if your like me and are new to the whole blazeds scene. Be careful you will nee to change the server web.xml file along with adding additional files under the ROOT/WEB-INF directory. One thing that helped me alot was the LOG files under tomcat_instal/LOG/logfilename.
Good luck to you  </p>
