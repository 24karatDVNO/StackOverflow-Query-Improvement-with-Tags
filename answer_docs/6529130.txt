<p>In my experience with MS SQL 2008 cell level encryption, you need to set up a master key for your database, create a certificate for your database, and based on that certificate a symmetric key that you will use to encrypt cell level data.</p>

<p>Columns for which you want to encrypt the data on have to be of one of type VARBINARY (or two others: I believe VARCHAR, and NVARCHAR, but I'm not certain). There is also a specific method of inserting/updating data in these columns, as well as reading data from these columns.</p>

<p>We're currently storing a few selected columns of sensitive information encrypted in this manner in VARBINARY(256) columns, along with TDE on top of our database.</p>
