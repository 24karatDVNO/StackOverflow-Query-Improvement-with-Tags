<p>I don't think it's possible to keep people from changing an object that you've constructed in javascript.</p>

<p>You could store a hash of the data and verify the hash is still correct whenever you use the data from the object, but that would just make it harder for a savvy user to change the object, not impossible. (Security by obfuscation, isn't really security, at all.)</p>
