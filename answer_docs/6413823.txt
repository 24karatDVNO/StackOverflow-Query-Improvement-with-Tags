<p>Using a consistent path structure among all devs should help. As far as third party libraries go, it is a good idea to check them in with the project itself. That way you can grab the latest code and build. In my experience, TFS doesn't do well with binary check ins, and because of the integration with visual studio, unless you add solution items and include the libraries there, updating them to new versions can be a pain. You can manage them outside of the solution using the Source Control tools if you don't mind leaving solution explorer for a little bit to manage dependencies.</p>

<p>With web.config files, I tend to check in a web.config.template file, and all changes go there. Then developers can edit the web.config all they want for their local environment and not mess up anyone else. But you do have to remember to ensure changes make it to the template file. Not a perfect scenario.</p>
