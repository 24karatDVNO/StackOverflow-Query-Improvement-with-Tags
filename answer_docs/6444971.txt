<p>Quoting from <a href="http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596806033" rel="nofollow">"HTML5: Up and Running"</a> by Mark Pilgrim:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The <code>placeholder</code> atttribute can only
  contain text, not HTML markup.
  However, there are some
  vendor-specific CSS extensions
  (http://trac.webkit.org/export/37527/trunk/LayoutTests/fast/forms/placeholder-pseudo-style.html)
  that allow you to style the
  placeholder text in some browsers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So I imagine you will have to fall back on a scripted solution for that aspect of your question at least, especially given that so far no version of IE supports placeholder text.</p>
