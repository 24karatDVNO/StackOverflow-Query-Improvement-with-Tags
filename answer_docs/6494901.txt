<pre><code>ini_set('include_path', ini_get('include_path') . ':/path/to/eggs/libs'));
</code></pre>

<p>Putting this at the top of the script, before you do any includes, will save you having to do the paths in each include/require call. </p>

<p>Alternatively you can modify the <code>include_path</code> at the php.ini level so it's permanent for all scripts.</p>
