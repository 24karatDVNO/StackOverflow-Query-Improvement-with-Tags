<p>After completely uninstalling and re-installing the SDK I was able to see and install the Google USB driver but still have been unable to connect the debugger. Perhaps Android development on an Atom based XP Net-Book is a bad idea. I've not been able to get the emulator working so I thought it might be better debugging directly on the target. The emulator just locks up this PC. I've waited up to 40 minutes before giving up. I've had no trouble with Android development on my work PC (emulator or target) but I have some personal projects I'd rather not do on company equipment. Oh well, I probably just need a real PC if I want to work at home.</p>
