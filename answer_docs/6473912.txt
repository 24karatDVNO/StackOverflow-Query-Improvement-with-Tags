<p>This problem looks to be fixed in ADT 12. The following change in main_rules.xml solves the problem and should be included in ADT 12: <a href="https://review.source.android.com/#change,22791" rel="nofollow">https://review.source.android.com/#change,22791</a>.</p>

<p>I can verify that downloading the fixed version and replacing the copy that comes with the sdk at your_sdk_path/tools/ant fixes this issue.</p>
