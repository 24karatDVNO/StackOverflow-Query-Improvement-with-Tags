<p>It is possible to distribute flash created IPAs using adhoc OTA distribution. Apple has information on creating the necessary manifest plist <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#featuredarticles/FA_Wireless_Enterprise_App_Distribution/Introduction/Introduction.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You do not need an enterprise developer account for this to work but you will need access to a web server to host the files and talk to the apple servers (this can be hosted locally). Once everything is set up you can visit the web server from your iPhone and download the app. We distribute internal testing builds using this system and it functions very nicely.</p>
