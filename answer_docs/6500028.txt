<p>The query </p>

<pre><code>SELECT password 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'mail@gmail.com'
   AND ( activation = 1 OR activation = 2)
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT password 
FROM users 
WHERE email = 'mail@gmail.com'
   AND activation IN (1, 2)
</code></pre>

<p>so, you could also have:</p>

<pre><code>$stmt = $db-&gt;
  prepare('SELECT password FROM users WHERE email=? AND activation IN (?,?)'); 
</code></pre>

<p>No difference in performance, just a bit shorter. It may be helpful if you have not two but a lot of OR conditions for the same field.</p>
