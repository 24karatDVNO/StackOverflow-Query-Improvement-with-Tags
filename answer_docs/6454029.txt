<p>after spending hours trying to ultimatly discover the issue behind the Class Issue not being found, resolved,or directory not there issue....</p>

<p>sometimes yes the issue is due to a bad binary or xml...  as sometime a clean will do the trick or a xml edit will solve the day..  when all else fails....  this may do it..</p>

<p>"create a new workspace"</p>

<p>go into the workspace.... and then </p>

<p>Switch to your old workspace...  in the newly formed workspace...</p>

<p>this was my silver bullet.  so frustrating to not have a solid answer.</p>
