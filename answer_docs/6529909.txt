<p>When you say that you "think it's rendering in quirks mode"-- why do you think that? If you hit F12 on the page, what do you see in the Developer Tools toolbar for the Document Mode?</p>

<p>"Display Intranet sites in Compatibility Mode" will show Standards Mode sites in IE7 Standards Mode (rather than IE8 or IE9 Standards), and Quirks mode sites will continue to render in Quirks mode.</p>
