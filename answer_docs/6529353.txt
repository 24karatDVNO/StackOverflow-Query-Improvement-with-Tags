<p>Here's an optimized way to do it. No speed difference, but it's good practice to know about.</p>

<ol>
<li>Use long instead of integer since excel natively uses longs</li>
<li><p>Unwrap the loop at least one level</p>

<pre><code>Dim Sum As Long
Dim i As Long

For i = 1 to 10 Step 2
   Sum = Sum + i
   Sum = Sum + (i + 1)
Next
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>I hope that helps!</p>
