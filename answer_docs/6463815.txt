<p>AFAIK, fillAndStroke cannot be used to draw an outline around a bar. This option is used exclusively when you want to add a stroked line to a filled line plot. You can refer to the filledLine.html example available in your JQPlot package. </p>

<p>I do not think there is a way to add an outline around a bar, either through one of the JQPlot options or using CSS.</p>
