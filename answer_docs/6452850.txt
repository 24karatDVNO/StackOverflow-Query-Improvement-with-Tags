<p>gcc will automatically align <code>__m128</code> members correctly if the object is created on the stack, but for objects allocated via <code>new</code> you are at the mercy of the memory allocator, which is typically only 8 byte aligned on Linux. You may need to override operator <code>new</code> for your class so that it calls <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/3/posix_memalign" rel="nofollow">posix_memalign</a> so that you always get 16 byte aligned objects.</p>

<p>Having said that, if you're getting into SSE code optimisation then you may want to re-evaluate how you do the coding - since performance is usually the motivation for SIMD optimisation you may want to work at a somewhat lower level than C++ classes - typically you just want to operate homogeneously on big chunks of contiguous data, i.e. 1D or 2D arrays.</p>
