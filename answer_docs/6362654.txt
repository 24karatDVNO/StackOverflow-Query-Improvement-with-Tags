<p>My first thought was to use Sets, as others have mentioned.  Another approach would be to use Java's version of the foreach, instead of using indexes.  A general approach:</p>

<pre><code>public static ArrayList removeDuplicates(ArrayList origList) {
    ArrayList newList = new ArrayList();
    for (Object m : origList) {
        if (!newList.contains(m)) {
            newList.add(m);
        }
    }
    return newList;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In testing, I just used Strings; I'd recommend inserting Customer into the code where appropriate for type safety.</p>
