<p>I think there are lot of issues in your question</p>

<ol>
<li>Connecting Buttons in Xib
If you want to connect a button via interfacebuilder you have to declare the button in the .h file as</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>IBOutlet</strong> UIButton *myButton;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This IBOutlet Indicates the Interface Builder that there is going to be a button placed in xib.
   Dont connect anything to the FirstResponder</p>

<ol>
<li><p>if you see this error "setting does not have outlet view" then in your xib you have removed the outlet connected to you View.
To Solve this right click the view in you xib and drag the New Referencing Outlet connector to the file owner. then select the view property there.</p></li>
<li><p>When you touch a button
You must have a IBAction to the button to assign via Interfacebuilder.
in your .h</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-(IBAction) onTouchEvent :(id)sender;</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ol>

<p>Now rightClick the button in your xib. choose TouchUpInside connector and drag to fileowner you can see the onTouchEvent pops out.</p>
