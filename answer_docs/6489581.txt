<p><a href="https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js/blob/master/lib/markdown.js" rel="nofollow">markdown-js</a> isn't finished yet but it's a JavaScript library for a subset of markdown that uses an AST rather than different stages of HTML conversion. It should produce sane HTML right from the start. I think that this approach, if executed properly, will make rendering markdown on the client side practical.</p>

<p>It intentionally doesn't support embedded HTML.</p>
