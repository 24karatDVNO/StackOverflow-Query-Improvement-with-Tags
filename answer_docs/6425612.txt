<p>Maybe you could create a project from your repository trunk? Eclipse handles this correctly for mvn projects at least, and this would allow you to commit the whole at once. If you don't want the eclipse metadata to be in your repository, add .settings, .classpath and .project in svn:ignore.</p>

<p>Personally I would do that using TortoiseSVN or the command-line client though.</p>
