<p>with regards to the batching requirment, please use Spring batching <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring-batch/reference/pdf/spring-batch-docs.pdf" rel="nofollow">link</a>
this provides all the necessary batching facilities needed.</p>

<p>Regarding the object loading issue, </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So a way around this which may not be
  the most optimal is - the batch class
  just calls a service to load all the
  IDs of those objects (long values) -
  and we pass this ID to a service
  method which will load that object
  from the DB by the ID and then do the
  processing on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>seems correct.</p>
