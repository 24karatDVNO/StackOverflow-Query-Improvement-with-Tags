<p>Try using GROUP BY instead of select DISTINCT.  Also you can move your sub-query from the WHERE clause and use it as a derived table in a join.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT EM.Employee, 
       RTRIM(EM.FirstName) + ' ' + RTRIM(EM.LastName) AS Name 
FROM EM EM 
INNER JOIN PR PR 
    ON EM.Employee = PR.ProjMgr 
INNER JOIN (SELECT WTS1 
              FROM TabFields 
             WHERE custInclude = 'Y' AND WTS2 = ''
             GROUP BY WTS1) x
    ON PR.WTS1 = x.WTS1
    AND PR.WTS2 = '' 
GROUP BY EM.Employee,    RTRIM(EM.FirstName) + ' ' + RTRIM(EM.LastName) 
ORDER BY RTRIM(EM.FirstName) + ' ' + RTRIM(EM.LastName)
</code></pre>
