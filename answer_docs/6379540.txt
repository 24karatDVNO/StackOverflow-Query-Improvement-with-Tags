<p>mads.ohm is correct about combining the two queries into a single query.</p>

<p>As for your problem with only getting one return value, your while loop is just overwriting the contents of $data2 each time through.</p>

<p>You could write something like this instead:</p>

<pre><code>$i = 0;
$data2 = array();
while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($results2)) {

    $data2[$i] = $row;
    $i++;

}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, $data2 is declared as an array, and each iteration of the while loop adds a row from the database to the array.</p>
