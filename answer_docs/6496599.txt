<p>I don't know of any that exist...you could do PHP but that would change the HTML output.  The only other way would be to use Javascript and load the whole document and try and find it...I could do something similar in PHP but not in Javascript yet...I would assume a JQuery start-off approach could be something like:</p>

<pre><code>var wholesite = $(document).html()//gets the html
///then code to find and replace orange.png....
</code></pre>
