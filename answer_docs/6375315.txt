<p>I found the solution. It was not the tilde or bad .js. It was what I thought... css. Once I started specifying the widths of the boxes my scripting was building it all came together. Other browsers, it seems, was assuming widths.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for your input.</p>

<p>On another note, though I do like JQuery and am using it from time to time, I like the raw power of JS better. And even with using JQuery, I would have had to still specify widths to get it right.</p>
