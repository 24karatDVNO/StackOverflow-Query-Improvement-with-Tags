<p>The problem you are facing is that while <code>ClassA</code> and <code>ClassB</code> have a specific relationship, <code>List&lt;ClassA&gt;</code> and <code>List&lt;ClassB&gt;</code> do not have one.</p>

<p>You cannot assign, instead you have to insert the elements in the first list to the second list one-by-one.</p>
