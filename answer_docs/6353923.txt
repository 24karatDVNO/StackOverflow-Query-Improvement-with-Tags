<p>I am not sure about how to do this in codeIgniter, but the ideal approach for the same would be to have your javascript load data in AJAX, i.e. the request mime type for the same would be application/json. Hence in your controller for the url /user/20 you should then check the request mime type and respond accordingly. If the mime type is application/json then great, otherwise you may redirect the user to the appropriate url you intended.</p>
