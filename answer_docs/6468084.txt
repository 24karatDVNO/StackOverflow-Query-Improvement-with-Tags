<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table#Drawbacks" rel="nofollow">drawbacks</a> of a hash table.  Then look at the advantages and determine if you are using the right data structure.  If you very rarely sort, then you may be using the right data structure.  In this case, sorting will require you enumerate the values and put them into a list.  If sort if frequent, consider moving to a different data structure, like a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms379573.aspx" rel="nofollow">search tree</a>.  If you rarely do lookups/searches, I would consider using an ordinary list.</p>
