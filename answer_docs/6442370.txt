<p>you are doing it wrong, you don't have to concate..try this:</p>

<p>$current_sort = "title";
$order = "asc";
$myposts = get_posts(
    array(
        'cat' => "$cat,-$catHidden",
        'numberposts' => $my_current_count,
        'orderby'=> $current_sort,
        'order' => $order
        )); </p>
