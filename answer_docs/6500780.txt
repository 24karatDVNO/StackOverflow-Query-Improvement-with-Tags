<p>Recursive flattening of any iterable types, except leaving strings alone (since you probably don't want to split those into characters):</p>

<pre><code>def flatten(x):
  try:
    if isinstance(x, basestring): raise TypeError
    y = iter(x)
  except TypeError:
    yield x
    return
  for item in y:
    for subitem in flatten(item):
      yield subitem
</code></pre>
