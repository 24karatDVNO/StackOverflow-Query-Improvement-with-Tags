<p>I've used Kannel in my previous gig and I spoke with the main contributors. At the moment, there is no queuing mechanism with the exception of a db, but there has been talks about that. It's important to mentioned that we used Kannel in production with a load of 200 msg/sec with no a problems. The architecture that we implemented was using the straight SMSBox HTTP protocol and putting ActiveMQ to get those messages into a queue.</p>

<p>Let me know if that helps!
