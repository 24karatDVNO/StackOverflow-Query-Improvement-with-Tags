<p>If you wanted to seperate out your css to make it easier to manage. You could separate your css into seperate files and call the using <code>@import url();</code>. For example:</p>

<p>core.css would be like so:</p>

<pre><code>//Navigation styles
@import url("navigation.css");

//Banner styles
@import url("banner.css");

//Footer styles
@import url("footer.css");
</code></pre>

<p>This would however create one style sheet, which includes the separate referenced ones.</p>
