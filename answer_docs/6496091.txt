<p>As one can see, this is for PHP quick conditionals. This then places the cursor in the spot where you start typing the condition. Perfect no matter where your throwing it into. I put this to Ctrl+NUMPAD0 for quick typing access. I orignally had it to two TABs but that quickly got annoying haha</p>
