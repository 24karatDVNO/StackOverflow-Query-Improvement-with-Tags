<p>The problem here is the INT signal is being received by your script AND by your command <code>find /</code>, so it exits.</p>

<p>You can fully ignore the signal(s) with:</p>



<pre class="lang-shell prettyprint-override"><code>trap '' SIGNINT
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know if it's possible to catch the signal and prevent that your commands receive it.</p>
