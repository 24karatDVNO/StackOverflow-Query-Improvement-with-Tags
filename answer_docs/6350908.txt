<p>Also bear in my mind that the debug player behaves very differently from the standard player, and (a separate issue) that during a debug session, significant slowdowns can be apparent with performance critical code... Only believe the browser plugin, non-debug version, running in a browser, not debugging. That is the only reliable test. I have seen speed up of 25-30x  just by changing to the release player (extreme case). Thought I had a major performance problem, but actually didn't :)</p>
