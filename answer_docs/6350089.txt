<p>URL rewriting is a common solution for this problem. You give it the patterns of the URL's you want to match and what it needs to change it into. So it would detect www.mySite.com/ssride360 and transform it into www.mySite.com?name=ssride360. The user of the website sees the original URL and doesn't know anything changed, but your code sees the transformed URL so you can access the variables in the normal way. Another big plus is that the rules allow you to set the patterns that get transformed as well as the ones that just get passed through to actual folders / files.</p>
