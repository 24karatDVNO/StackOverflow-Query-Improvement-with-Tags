<p>You are probably already using itemized overlays. Your OverlayItem class has a method that returns a Drawable; you can create your own Drawable class that your OverlayItem will return. As for the variable size, you could handle that two ways: either your Drawable could determine its own size (using Paint.measureText() ), or, possibly, you could create a View class to take advantage of a View's ability to figure its own layout, and have your Drawable's draw() method delegate to the View's draw() method. Someone who understands Views better than I do can probably improve on that suggestion.</p>
