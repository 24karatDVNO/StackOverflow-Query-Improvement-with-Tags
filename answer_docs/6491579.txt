<p>Following on from Simon Thompson's answer (good answer simon).</p>

<p>I think your approaching this from the wrong side. A popup is not something created on the server side, instead it is something created on the client-side either in pure html or javascript.</p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="http://google.com" target="_blank"&gt;open google in a popup&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Here is some more details about popup's: <a href="http://www.quirksmode.org/js/popup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quirksmode.org/js/popup.html</a></p>

<p>The quirksmode tutorial is a useful introduction, however to implement I would not use the approach and instead use a more "unobtrusive" approach (but i'd look into this later once you have a grasp of the popup fundamentals).</p>
