<p>ok! :) after some long research i've found an answer.</p>

<p>what i've done was to move the business.php file into a dedicated folder along with the System and Application folders, once that's done i've created a second .htaccess file with the above given code and placed it in the same sub-folder.</p>

<p>and finally, instead of calling to 'mysite.com/business.php/myController' i need to call to 'site.com/business/business/php/myController'</p>

<p>that way BOTH sites work perfectly fine!</p>

<p>another thing though, i'd love it if some one could tell me what code to i need to use in the .htaccess file to change all my long URL to a nicer one, i've tried the common commands but they didn't work.</p>

<p>thank you all so very much for your tries.</p>
