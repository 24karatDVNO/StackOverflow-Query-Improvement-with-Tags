<p>Without knowing what <code>$usersClass-&gt;register()</code> returns it's difficult to make a determination over what is going wrong. I do advise you try something like the following (just for debugging purposes):</p>

<pre><code>var_dump($_POST);
$_test = $usersClass-&gt;register($_POST['produgg_username'], md5($_POST['produgg_password']), $_POST['produgg_email'], $randomkey);
var_dump($_test);
// proceed on with your if statement.
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you're seeing what you expect to see. A few echo's in developement code never hurt anyone, just make sure they're removed for release purposes.</p>
