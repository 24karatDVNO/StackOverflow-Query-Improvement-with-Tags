<p>Okay, it turns out that the schema specification is contained in the <code>model.xml</code> file.</p>

<p>You can simply open this file with your favourite editor and replace the old schema name <code>XYZ_PAX</code> with whatever you need, such as <code>XYZ</code>.</p>

<p>Then you open the CPF project file in Framework Manager and republish. This will push the changed model out to the Cognos server.</p>

<p>Any reports then created will use the new model and you can open up each existing report in Report Studio and it will automatically revalidate with the new model. Just remember to save the report design when finished.</p>
