<p>Since you are catching the Exception; the fillUI() function is never notified of any error.</p>

<p>Your codepath is as following:
fillUI -> getDetailedItem -> exception caught -> closeAndShowError -> finish() -> return to closeAndShowError -> return to getDetailedItem after caught block -> return back to fillUI.</p>

<p>So basically, the code after getDetailedItem in fillUI is called because you caught the exception and didn't let the other function know. Either by return value, or by throwing (and maybe catching) a new exception.</p>
