<p>All input fields will be passed as part of your $_POST or $_GET arrays, based on the method type of your form submission.  Checkboxes are passed as name=on or name= whether the checkboxes are selected or not. Depending on how you're processing the submitted form data there are different ways to work with the values.  I hope this helps?</p>
