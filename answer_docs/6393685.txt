<p>In this app, if the user hits 1 or 2, it means that they wanted to see either monthly or total rainfall. What this implies is that they haven't requested to 'End program'. The code assumes that if the user has chosen 1 or 2 that they should continue using the application. If they have chosen ANYTHING else, (eg. <code>3</code>, just like the menu says) then the condition <code>choice == 1 || choice == 2</code> will evaluate to <code>false</code> and the loop with terminate, resulting in the application closing.</p>
