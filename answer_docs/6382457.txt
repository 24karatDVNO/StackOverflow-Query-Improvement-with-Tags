<p>There's a new open source build system for Java called <a href="http://ebuild-project.org/" rel="nofollow">EBuild</a> (<a href="http://ebuild-project.org/Discover.html" rel="nofollow">features</a>) that is a great alternative to Ant/Ivy as it is especially good at dependency management.</p>

<p>There's some detailed articles on the <a href="http://ebuild-project.org/articles/a_critical_retrospective_ant.html" rel="nofollow">deficiencies of Ant</a> and also <a href="http://ebuild-project.org/articles/maven_the_bad_parts.html" rel="nofollow">Maven</a> on the site.</p>
