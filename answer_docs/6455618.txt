<p>Well guys first look at the query which is returning the wrong results:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  
        e.*
FROM    CustomerEmails e 
WHERE   EXISTS 
        (
            SELECT  Email 
            FROM    CustomerEmailIds c 
            WHERE   ( ISNULL(e.[From],'') + '/' + ISNULL(e.[To],'') ) LIKE  '%'+c.Email+'%' 
        )
</code></pre>

<p>There is no issue in this query, the issue is that some of the emails in CustomerEmailIds table are <strong>invalid emails which are ('.','@','0','-')</strong> &amp; that's why the query is returning all the CustomerEmails where these invalid emails exists.</p>
