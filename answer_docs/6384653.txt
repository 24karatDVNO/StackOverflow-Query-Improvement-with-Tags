<p>Personally I use <a href="http://nunitforms.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://nunitforms.sourceforge.net/</a> NUnitForms. It's an extension of the venerable NUnit framework and supports Visual Studio. There are lots of plugins for Visual Studio that can help with managing your tests. I use JetBrains Resharper <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/</a> to do the trick. You can also just use the built in functionality and run the tests from NUnit itself.</p>

<p>Hope this helps,</p>
