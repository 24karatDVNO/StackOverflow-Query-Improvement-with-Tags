<p>Given your error message, it's obvious that your query is failing. You've supressed errors with <code>@</code> on it, so the <code>or die(...)</code> never kicks in.</p>

<p>Your <code>$table_name</code> in the query is undefined, so the query looks like</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO (name, question) ...
</code></pre>

<p>which is incorrect SQL.</p>

<p>The two major fixes you need:</p>

<ol>
<li>Remove the <code>@</code> supression on mysql_query(). It is almost NEVER acceptable to supress errors, particularly when dealing with a database.</li>
<li>Define <code>$table_name</code> in your script, or change the variable inside the query string to a proper table name.</li>
</ol>
