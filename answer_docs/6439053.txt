<p>You'll have to run a wrapper shell script that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>source myscript.sh
env
</code></pre>

<p>and then read the output of the 'env' command and set the environment within your perl program from that.</p>

<p>So you need to run the wrapper script like this:</p>

<pre><code>open CMD, "wrapper.sh|";
</code></pre>
