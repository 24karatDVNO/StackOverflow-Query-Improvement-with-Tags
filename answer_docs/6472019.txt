<p>Likely an unchecked exception other than <code>NumberFormatException</code> is being thrown, for example <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p>

<p>A NPE could be thrown if either <code>field1</code> or <code>mContext</code> are not properly initialized.</p>

<p>Regardless, you need to get logcat working so you can debug the problem. The stacktrace will point you to where the error is occuring.</p>

<p>To open logcat in Eclipse, go to Window > Show View > Other... and select the logcat view.</p>

<p>Alternatively you can access the logcat view from Window > Open Perspective > Other... and select the DDMS perspective.</p>
