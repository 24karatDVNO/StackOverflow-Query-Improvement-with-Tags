<p>If one of you activity is more central than the other, you should use startActivityForResult in it. It will call the second one, and one the second one finished it can communicate results and extra in a bundle too. </p>

<p>This model looks cleaner, at least more standard, than a loop between activities. Although what you do and the way you do it should also work.</p>

<p>Btw, your activities may have a dialog theme but they are not dialogs, no ?</p>
