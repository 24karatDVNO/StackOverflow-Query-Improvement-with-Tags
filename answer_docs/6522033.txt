<p>I think you will find the problem is a bit more abstract than you think. The question you are asking is really "I have a job that I don't know how long it's going to take, when can I say that I am halfway done?" The answer: You can't. Progress bars are there to display progress as a percentage of the whole. If you don't know the total or the percentage then a progress bar is no fun. </p>
