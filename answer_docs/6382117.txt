<p>Combine this with offline storage concept and you have a winner. All your major navigation pages could be prefetched and each landing page of those could prefetch the next ones and so on, placing in offline storage (window.localStorage or window.sessionStorage). Would be great for JSON etc. You could control better than with cache on what needs to expire or not as your keys could contain a timestamp indicator. Probably more suitable to ecommerce sites where product catalogs don't need to be loaded everytime. You could put your JSON in there for example and spring it back to life immediately.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if offline storage is good or not for this considering cache. Thoughts?</p>
