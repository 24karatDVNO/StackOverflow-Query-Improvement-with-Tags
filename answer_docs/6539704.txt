<p>I had this exact same error.  I was using mapped drives to copy data to SharePoint.  I found that my xml file on the SharePoint mapped drive (destination) was applied with encryption attributes recently applied to my pc (source).  </p>

<p>I am still looking for a way to use robocopy or powershell to remove the encryption from the destination file programatically.</p>

<p>To manually remove the attribute, navigate to the mapped drive, go to properties of the xml file, at the bottom in Attributes click Advanced, uncheck 'Encrypt contents..', apply.</p>

<p>(**For those not sure how to see the attributes)
Open explorer for your mapped drive, on the column header bar right click and choose attributes.  You can see the security applied.  E is encryption.</p>
