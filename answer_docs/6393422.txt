<p>I've tested this on the emulator with 1.6 and it works.</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4721449/enable-gps-programatically-like-tasker">How can I enable or disable the GPS programmatically on Android?</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> This is not particularly allowed on the Android Market, and it stopped working as of android 2.3. I have also tested on a 2.1 emulator, and two actual devices with 2.2, and it worked on those.</p>
