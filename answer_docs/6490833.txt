<p>You cannot do that Henkka. Href just tells browser to request another page. That request can have get parameters along with url. POST contents are passed along with the content and href is not designed to do that. For that we need to use AJAX. <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">jQuery provides and easy method to perform POST</a>. If it is an application for large amount of users, go for normal submit button. jQuery works only if javascript is enabled in the users browser.</p>
