<p>In the past I have used <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/" rel="nofollow">LiquiBase</a>, a Java-based tool where you configure your migrations as XML files. You can generate the necessary SQL with it.</p>

<p>Today I'd use the <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/" rel="nofollow">Doctrine 2</a> library which has <a href="http://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/migrations/2.0/docs/reference/managing-migrations/en" rel="nofollow">migration facilities</a> similar to Ruby. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://symfony.com/" rel="nofollow">Symfony 2</a> framework also has a nice way to deal with schema changes - its command line tool can analyze the existing schema and generate SQL to match the database to the changed schema definitions.</p>
