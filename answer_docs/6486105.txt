<p>If the error is saying that the URL is malformed, it's probably true.
Here's a code I use to grab file from resource during test:</p>

<pre><code>def copyFileFromResource(source: String, dest: File) {
  val in = getClass.getResourceAsStream(source)
  val reader = new java.io.BufferedReader(new java.io.InputStreamReader(in))
  val out = new java.io.PrintWriter(new java.io.FileWriter(dest))
  var line: String = null
  line = reader.readLine
  while (line != null) {
    out.println(line)
    line = reader.readLine
  }
  in.close
  out.flush
}
</code></pre>
