<p>I had the exact same problem. By default, when you create an MVC3 app it sticks a web.debug.config and a web.release.config in the solution. When I got rid of those two items, the ViewBag issue resolved itself. It may have something to do with what Peter was saying above but I didn't test that.</p>
