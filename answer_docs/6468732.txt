<p>I'd like to think it was possible using the exslt set extensions</p>

<p>E.g.:</p>

<pre><code>//store[count(./book/@id) = count(set:intersection(./book/@id,//booklist/book/@id))]
</code></pre>

<p>But <code>intersection</code> doesn't seem to do what I expect it to within python's <code>lxml.etree</code></p>
