<p>Maybe just a not so nice pattern (having to create another object <em>and then</em> using the <code>toString()</code> method to actually get the <code>String</code>). Note also that as the <code>+</code> operator for <code>String</code>s is special, the compiler can internally optimize the string copies, so maybe in .NET there is no practical overhead.</p>
