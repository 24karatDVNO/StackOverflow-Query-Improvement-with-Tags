<p>Of course you can. Any reason as to why you would think otherwise?
You can have a class implemented multiple interfaces for a class. If C# didn't support methods outside of the interface... you wouldn't be able to do that.</p>

<pre><code>interface A{
    void DoA();
}

interface B{
    void DoB();
}

class C: A, B
{
    void DoA();
    void DoB();
    void DoC();
}
</code></pre>
