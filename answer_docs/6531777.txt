<p>There is a tutorial on SAX parsing <a href="http://www.jondev.net/articles/Android_XML_SAX_Parser_Example" rel="nofollow">here</a>, an example of HttpClient <a href="http://w3mentor.com/learn/java/android-development/android-http-services/example-of-http-get-request-using-httpclient-in-android/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and a tutorial on GridView <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/tutorials/views/hello-gridview.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<p>You'll need to parse your XML, store your URLs in a list, retrieve those URLs using HttpClient, load the images in to Bitmap objects, and set your ImageView objects in your <code>getView()</code> method of your <code>Adapter</code> using <code>imageView.setImageBitmap()</code>.</p>

<p>Sorry for the very broad answer, but it's a very broad question.</p>
