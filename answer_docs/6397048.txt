<p>In my reasonably extensive experience testing things in IE9 with the various different "Browser Modes" to test as the older versions of IE, it's been <em>exactly the same</em> as using the actual browser.</p>

<p>I do still have virtual machines containing the genuine versions, because there are (very rarely) differences.</p>

<p>But, they tend to be <em>bizarre edge cases</em>, and certainly not something as mundane as the size of a font.</p>

<p>I think you're having this problem: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6095308/horizontal-menu-displays-incorrect-on-widescreen-monitor/6095453#6095453">Horizontal Menu Displays Incorrect on Widescreen Monitor</a></p>

<p>..which is that the "Text Size" has been changed from the default.</p>
