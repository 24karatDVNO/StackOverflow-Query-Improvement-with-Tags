<p>You need a router, and apache mod_rewrite or equivalent. You set up mod_rewrite to send all requests to a single file, such as /index.php. The router then looks at the request URL and determines which controller file to load and which method to call. Pretty much any MVC framework has this functionality built-in, and they all work pretty much the same.</p>
