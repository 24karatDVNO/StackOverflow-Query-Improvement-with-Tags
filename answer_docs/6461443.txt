<p>AMF is completely built into the flash player, I don't think there's any way of messing with the parsing, BUT you could skip the native AMF, get a AMF (or something else) open source library and tamper with its parsing function.</p>

<p>I don't know if there IS a open source AMF library for flash since it has a native one, but who knows.</p>
