<p>Add </p>

<pre><code>layout_weight="1"
</code></pre>

<p>into your horizontal layout.
And you will need to add similar lines in the TextViews at the bottom if you want to see those also.</p>

<p>Your current problem is that you set that one to <code>fill_parent</code>, so when it gets to the ListView, there is no space available.</p>
