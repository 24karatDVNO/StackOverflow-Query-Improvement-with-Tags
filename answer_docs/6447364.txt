<p>Traditionally NetBeans had the better GUI layout tools in the free IDE's. It is/was called Matisse. </p>

<p>I heard rumors it was replaced in Netbeans7 by some GridBagLayout thingy, so you might want to drop bacl to 6.9 if that is the case. Maybe it is just additional and Matisse is still there.</p>

<p>If you want to stick with Eclipse, then the MyEclipse version also comes out of the box with a version of Matisse, but this costs you some  money for a subscription.</p>
