<p>I have this working now.</p>

<p>Lessons:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use render :partial instead of render :update in the controller</li>
<li>Use unobtrusive JS to issue a get request to the controller</li>
<li>Use :remote => true on the form</li>
<li>Don't look for solutions or experiment at night when you've been working for the past 12+ hours</li>
</ol>

<p>The above list definitely seems to be "sufficient", but I'm not sure if everything in there is "necessary", but I'm going to move on using the above list for all of the other dynamic input fields on my form.</p>
