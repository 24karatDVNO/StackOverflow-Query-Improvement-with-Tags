<p>You can use a Merge Join Transformation with a full outer join (remember to sort your datasets before they input to the Merge Join Transformation), then have the output go to a Conditional Split Transformation. The Conditional Split Transformation can determine whether or not a row needs to be updated, inserted, or deleted and direct the flow to the appropriate transform to do that.</p>

<p>This was off the top of my head, and there may be a simpler transform for this. I haven't had the opportunity to work with SSIS in almost a year, so I might be getting a bit rusty.</p>
