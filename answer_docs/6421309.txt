<p>It should be as simple as:</p>

<pre><code>one_big_string = ' '.join(request.POST.getlist('myselectmultiple'))
mymodelinstance.field = one_big_string 
mymodelinstance.save()
</code></pre>

<p>I can guess at a few problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>You assign something to <code>table.conditions</code> but never save it. </li>
<li><code>MyModelInstance.save()</code> doesn't return anything by default, so you're most likely assigning <code>None</code> to <code>table.conditions</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope that helps - if you clarify your question at all I will respond in the morning. </p>
