<p>Rake isn't in your <code>$PATH</code>. I suppose you're using <code>rvm</code>, which operates via <code>.bashrc</code> to add <code>rake</code> to your <code>$PATH</code>. I'm not sure <code>:!source ~/.bashrc</code> helps. Some <code>.bashrc</code> got <code>[ -z "$PS1" ] &amp;&amp; return</code> to check for an interactive session on top. Be sure the <code>rvm</code> include is above that line.</p>
