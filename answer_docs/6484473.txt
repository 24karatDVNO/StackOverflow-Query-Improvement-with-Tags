<p>One more approach would be to <strong>use <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/alexfromsun/archive/2008/06/the_new_jxlayer.html" rel="nofollow">JXLayer</a></strong> (soon to be part of Swing as JLayer) with <a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/alexfromsun/archive/2008/07/jxlayer_30_lock.html" rel="nofollow">LockableUI</a>. </p>

<p>This solution requires additional library but it is infinitely more flexible and elegant.</p>
