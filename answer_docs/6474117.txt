<p>You said you referenced the dlls, but didn't say precisely where you referenced them.  I had a similar issue the first time I attempted to get a MATLAB dll from Builder NE working within a C# project.  Ultimately, it turned out that simply referencing the MATLAB dlls from within the .NET assembly that made use of them was insufficient.  It wasn't until I referenced the MATLAB dlls at the top level of the project that they actually loaded at runtime and things started working as expected.  Give it a try.  Add a reference to the dlls at the top level of the project.</p>
