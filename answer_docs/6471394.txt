<p>You're apparently trying to build a filter between the original page and the manipulated page. So in your JSP, you read the original page as text. If it's on your own server, you can just open the file and read it. Or you may need to create a Socket to read it across the Internet. Either way, you read it as text, insert whatever additional markup you need, and then write this marked-up version as the output of your JSP. Your JSP would then have no actual content itself, all the output would be produced within &lt;% and %&gt; with out.println statements. (JSP is not the most natural choice here, you might want to look into servlets, but whatever. There's nothing inherently wrong with a JSP with no actual text.)</p>
