<p>Since you haven't shown what the erroneous output is I can only make an educated guess on exactly what the problem might be, but in addition to the incorrect <code>scanf()</code> calls and the call to <code>free</code> that is deleting the additional allocated nodes in your list, you have "empty" nodes for <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code>.  So when you traverse your linked list, you will need to take into account that the <code>head</code> and <code>tail</code> nodes are empty, otherwise you're going to get some odd values for those nodes since they are uninitialized.</p>
