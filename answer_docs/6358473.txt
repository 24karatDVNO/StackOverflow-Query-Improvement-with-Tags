<p>Python dictionaries have a fast path for string keys, so use these (rather than, say, tuples). The hash value of a string is cached in that string, so it's more important that the strings remain the same ones than their actual value; string constants (i.e., strings that appear verbatim in the program and are not the result of a calculation) always remain exactly the same, so as long as you use those, there's no need to worry.</p>
