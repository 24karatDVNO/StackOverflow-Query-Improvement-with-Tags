<p>There is a function (imagefontwidth and imagefontheight), but they only return the size of one character using the built-in fonts (which are all fixed-width). You'll get the width/height of the entire string by multiplying the number returned by the number of characters.</p>

<p>I don't know of any way that lets you get the width or height of a string using a custom font, but I'm interested in this too.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
