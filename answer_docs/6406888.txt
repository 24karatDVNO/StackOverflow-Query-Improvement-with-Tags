<p>There is no built-in/platform layout resource that provides a dialpad. What's probably the easiest thing to do is use the standard Contacts app's layout as seen at <a href="https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Contacts/+/gingerbread-release/res/layout-finger/dialpad.xml" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/apps/Contacts/+/gingerbread-release/res/layout-finger/dialpad.xml</a></p>

<p>Let me know if that helps.</p>
