<p>The library in Xcode 4 is tricky to find and occasionally hidden.</p>

<p>In IB mode, make sure the right drawer is open, then look at the very bottom of it. There should be a small area containing the Library. If not, there should be 4 buttons at the very bottom of the right drawer. In order: "Piece of Paper", "Brackets", "Box", "Movie". Click the box to open the Library. Then drag to resize it to a humane height.</p>
