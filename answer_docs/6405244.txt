<p>ClientPortOptions and DaemonPortOptions are special cases since multiple
clients/daemons can be defined.  This can be done via</p>

<pre><code>CLIENT_OPTIONS(`field1=value1,field2=value2,...')
DAEMON_OPTIONS(`field1=value1,field2=value2,...')
</code></pre>

<p>Note that multiple CLIENT_OPTIONS() commands (and therefore multiple
ClientPortOptions settings) are allowed in order to give settings for each
protocol family (e.g., one for Family=inet and one for Family=inet6).  A
restriction placed on one family only affects outgoing connections on that
particular family.</p>
