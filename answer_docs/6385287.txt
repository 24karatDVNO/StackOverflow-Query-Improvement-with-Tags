<p>I think the only reasonable solution for this is: </p>

<ul>
<li>Grab data by chunks (for example 100 rows / per request) in JSON</li>
<li>Insert it into table using DocumentFragment where it's possible</li>
<li>handle scrolling events and load more data as soon user need it (scroll to the end of table).</li>
</ul>
