<p>I am writing this on a hunch, so it may well not be correct, but hopefully it will serve as some sort of guide as to where to start looking: I think the problem is that, if the code provided really is all you've got, the website is static - i.e. there is no possibility of <em>really</em> selecting something. Once the user makes a change to what is currently displayed in the dropdown menu your script doesn't notice, as it's already done its job and the last line has already been executed. The change in the dropdown menu does not get passed on (or even noticed) by the web server, and thus <code>@selected</code> will remain an empty list (that said, I don't know why <code>@selected</code> does not at least contain your default selection, but perhaps I'm overlooking something here).</p>

<p>On a side note, you could also change <code>@selected</code> to <code>$selected</code>, as your dropdown menu does not allow multiple selections anyway.</p>
