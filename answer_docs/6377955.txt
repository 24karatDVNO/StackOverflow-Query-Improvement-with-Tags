<p>This does not seem like a very safe thing to do.</p>

<pre><code>public TResult CreateToType&lt;TType,TResult&gt;() where TType : new() where TResult : class
{
    return new TType() as TResult;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit - hmm this actually won't do what you want, as your trying to cast to an interface. Woops.</p>
