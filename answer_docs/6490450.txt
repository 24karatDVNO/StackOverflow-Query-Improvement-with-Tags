<p>The best way to learn SWT and its layouts is trying things out yourself.<br>
But I recommend the following ressources for a start:</p>

<ul>
<li>The noteworthy SWT tutorial on <a href="http://zetcode.com/tutorials/javaswttutorial/" rel="nofollow">Zetcode</a></li>
<li>Furthermore the eclipse / JFace / SWT section on <a href="http://java2s.com/Code/Java/SWT-JFace-Eclipse/CatalogSWT-JFace-Eclipse.htm" rel="nofollow">java2s</a></li>
<li>Last but not least the official SWT homepage with its <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/examples.php" rel="nofollow">examples</a> and if you like its <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/widgets/" rel="nofollow">widget page</a> with links to javadoc and code snippets</li>
</ul>
