<p>Under 1.9, one thread can be doing I/O, while another thread is <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/08/14/threads-in-ruby-enough-already/" rel="nofollow">doing CPU work</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve heard a common misperception that
  Ruby inherently “blocks” when doing
  disk IO or making database queries. In
  reality, Ruby switches to another
  thread whenever it needs to block for
  IO. In other words, if a thread needs
  to wait, but isn’t using any CPU,
  Ruby’s built-in methods allow another
  waiting thread to use the CPU while
  the original thread waits.</p>

<p>Which isn't much help for me, as I'm not I/O bound, but it may be good news for you.</p>
