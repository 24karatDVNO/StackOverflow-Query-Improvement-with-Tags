<p>If your <code>&lt;script src="jquery-whatever.js&gt;</code> line precedes the first clickable element in your HTML, it is guaranteed that the jquery library will be loaded and run before the user has anything useful to click on.</p>

<p>Just don't add async or defer attributes to the script element.</p>
