<p>You don't need Eclipse to run the emulator. You can simply download the android SDK <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" rel="nofollow">HERE</a>. After you've extracted the SDK, run the file "android" in the tools folder (in linux at least),  download which platforms you want to use (1.6, 2.1, etc) and create an emulator. It's fairly simple to do.</p>
