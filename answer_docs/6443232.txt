<p>Depending on how large the list of random numbers you're excluding, I would just generate your numbers and check if it's in the array of excluded numbers- if it is, just discard it. I know you don't want to check every time, but I can't think of another way besides specifying the ranges explicitly and if you have more than 5 numbers you're excluding that might be a bit worse.</p>
