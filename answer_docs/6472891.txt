<p>Using the <code>.active</code> class with background color SHOULD work, however, it depends on what other CSS you have.  You have to make sure the specificity of the <code>.active</code> or <code>#current</code> is greater than the default styling (<code>#horiz-menu ul li</code>).  Also, be sure to double check that it is the <code>li</code> that has the default background css rather than the anchor inside of it.</p>
