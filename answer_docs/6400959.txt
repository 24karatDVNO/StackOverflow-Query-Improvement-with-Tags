<p>You could make a quick bash script that iterates through different letters from a to z for one of your two stars, then, for each results, you add the result from wc to the current total for each itteration and you return the result.</p>

<p>You could also see if it would work just using:</p>

<pre><code>[a-m]*
[o-z]*
</code></pre>

<p>on just two different commands. Might be simplier, although I do not know the limit of number of arguments.</p>
