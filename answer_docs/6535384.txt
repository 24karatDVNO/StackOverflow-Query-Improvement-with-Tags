<p>I think the problem is the <code>SELECT</code>.</p>

<p>You are <code>SELECT</code>ing from a table variable that is not declared in the query, so there's nothing for BCP to do.</p>

<p>Table variables only persist for the context they are called in, so even if you have one in a query, and you have dynamic sql or a subproc within that first query, they won't be able to see the table variable.</p>
