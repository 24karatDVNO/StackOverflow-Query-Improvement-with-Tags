<p>What I found now is that OpenOffice aka LibreOffice has kind of versioning inside. LibreOffice file is a zip file with a structured content (XMLs, direcories, ...) inside. You are able to mark the current content as a version. This results in creating a VersionList.xml which contains information about all the versions. A Versions directory is added and this contains files like Version1, Version2 and so on. These files are the actual documents at that state.</p>
