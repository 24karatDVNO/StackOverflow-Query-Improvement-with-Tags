<p>chances are it does show, but you don't have enough time to see it happen(the destruction would happen during the "return 0;" statement".</p>

<p>Prehapse if you were to put that code into a function, you'd be able to see the destruction of localObj,since it'd fall out of scope after you leave the function:</p>

<pre><code>void f(){
    Tester localObj(3);
    cout&lt;&lt;"In local function f";
}

/*...*/ 

int main(){
    f();
    system("pause");
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
