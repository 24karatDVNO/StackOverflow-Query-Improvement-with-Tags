<p>Check out sys.foreign_keys for some SQL Server-specific action.  Specifically, it seems that you're interested in the delete_referential_action_desc and update_referential_action_desc columns.  As far as I know, there's no way to update a child table and have the update automatically propagate to the parent.  I'm willing to be corrected, though. </p>
