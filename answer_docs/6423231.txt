<p>I'm stabbing the dark here, but it sounds like the validations keep being included every time the model is loaded/saved.</p>

<p>Can you show us where you include it?</p>

<p>In Hyperactive Resource, instead of include we used:</p>

<pre><code># make validations work just like ActiveRecord by pulling them in directly
require "active_record/validations.rb"
extend ActiveRecord::Validations::ClassMethods
</code></pre>
