<p>Form an inner table called latest_animals that will calculate the latest entry date for each animal.
Form another inner table called previous_animals that will calculate the previous latest entry date for each animal.</p>

<p>Do a left join between these 2 tables based on the animal name and filter the record based on the time-diff between the 2 dates.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT latest_animals.animal_name, TIME_DIFF(latest_animals.created_at, previous_animals.created_at) created_diff FROM

(
  SELECT animal_name, MAX(date) created_at FROM animals GROUP BY animal_name
) latest_animals
LEFT JOIN
(
  SELECT animal_name, MAX(date) created_at FROM animals GROUP BY animal_name WHERE id NOT IN
  (SELECT id, MAX(date) FROM animals GROUP BY animal_name)
) previous_animals
ON latest_animals.animal_name =  previous_animals.animal_name
WHERE created_diff &gt; INTERVAL 30 MINUTE
