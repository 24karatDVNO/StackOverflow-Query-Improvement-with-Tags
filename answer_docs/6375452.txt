<p>The main difference between the concept of Functional programming an Object Oriented Programing is the question "Who's doing the work ?"</p>

<p>In <strong>Functional</strong> programming you have methods that perform operations on structures of data.</p>

<p>In <strong>Object Oriented Programing</strong> the idea is that the object themselves are working.</p>

<p>OOP in most cases gives you a more intuitive abstraction of a problem, and allows you to design more complicated structures while assigning roles to objects as players.</p>

<p>Of course under it all its just a bunch of code with functions calling each other. Just the concept is different.</p>
