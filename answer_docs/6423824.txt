<p>iTunes stores its library as an XML file so I suppose you could manipulate that directly from within Java.  Of course you'd have to be careful with this approach as different versions of iTunes have different XML formats, and if you invalidate the library than all the metadata iTunes is holding about the tracks in its library will be lost. </p>
