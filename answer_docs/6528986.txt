<p>You'd need to use the codebehind.</p>

<p>Have all the controls you need created on both panels, and in the codebehind, create a SelectedNodeChange event handler for the TreeView. In this event handler, you'd show/hide the controls you need at that point, and set the properties you need at that moment as well.</p>

<p>If you want to show/hide certain controls depending on the parent of a selected node: you can do something like this:</p>

<p>Say you have a treeview consisting of something like this</p>

<pre><code>Ford
 -Fiesta
 -Mondeo
BMW
 -316
 -318
 -320
</code></pre>

<p>And you want to show textBox1 ONLY IF a BMW model is selected, you'd do something like this in the event handler:</p>

<pre><code>if (CarsTreeView.Parent.SelectedNode.Text == "BMW")
{
  textBox1.Visible = true;
}
else
{
  textBox1.Visible = false;
}
</code></pre>
