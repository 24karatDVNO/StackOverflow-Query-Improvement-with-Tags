<p><strong>General approach</strong></p>

<p>I may start out by peeking at the software (component) from bird-view. Dependency analysis and graphing tools are a great help here (see later sections). I look for a circle in either the package-level or the class-level dependencies, and also alternatively for classes with too many dependencies. These are good candidates for refactoring.</p>
