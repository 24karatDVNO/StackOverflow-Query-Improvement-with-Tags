<p>Isn't that what a node in an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-ary_tree" rel="nofollow">n-ary tree</a> contains? Each node can contain up to at most n children. Each node in a binary tree can have 2 children. Each node in a ternary tree can have  a list (or other collection) of up to 3 children. Etc.</p>

<p>Am I misunderstanding the question?</p>
