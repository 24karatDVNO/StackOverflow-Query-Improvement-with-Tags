<p>The copying is easy:</p>

<pre><code>destination &lt;&lt; source.rdbuf();
</code></pre>

<p>Writing the <code>streambuf</code> to handles the different sources and
destinations is less obvious, although if you have a good library which
handles all of the dirty work, it shouldn't be too hard to wrap it in a
<code>streambuf</code>.  (Otherwise: a robust implementation of any socket protocol
is not something for someone not strong at C++.)</p>
