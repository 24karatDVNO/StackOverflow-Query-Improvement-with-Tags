<p>The main reason for password expiry is to make compromised passwords expire; telling the user (or the attacker) that it'll expire doesn't change this. What it <em>does</em> do is tell the attacker to compromise something else before the deadline; whether this is a risk depends on whether there are such attackers (I'd expect the first thing to do would be to install a rootkit).</p>

<p>The security benefit is that the user is given some amount of time (e.g. a week) to think of a new password. I can come up with a half-decent password in a minute or two, provided I'm not in a rush to get work done; otherwise I'd just increment a counter on the end. <em>Everyone does this.</em></p>

<p>My feeling is that the benefit of effectively saying "at some point in the next week, think of a new password" outweighs the potential risks, but 30 days is far too short. There are only a handful of passwords that I actually need to remember (phone, laptop+root, home server+root, work computer+server, password safe); changing any of these is tedious.</p>

<p>There are various ways of ensuring that users don't choose passwords related to old passwords; none of them are particularly good.</p>
