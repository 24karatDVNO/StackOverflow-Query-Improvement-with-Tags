<p>I'm trying to understand your situation... To me it looks like you've copied the XSLT from the mini and pasted it into sitecore, is that right? I haven't done that but if you're going to render the results in sitecore you need to get the XML results from the mini. You do that by removing the proxystylesheet parameter and it's accociated value in tje request URL. Have you done that?</p>
