<p>Web services would be a bit heavy handed option, esp if you opt for the SOAP ones. If you don't have a problem with the client and server always being Java, RMI seems to be the simplest solution to this problem since it's communication between two different JVM's using the normal method calling mechanism (with some additional interfaces and rules to be followed to please the RMI specification).</p>
