<p>I'm not an expert at dotnet technology.
on my point of view, server side scripting and client side scripting shall be separate.</p>

<p>as javascript jquery is client side and dotnet is server side.</p>

<p>the server will handler request and process the server script then send the output to user browser, then only jquery function happen at user side.</p>

<p>basically for whatever need to be execute at client browser I will put them all in view (html).
 jquery and javascript they will probably need to run in html with script tag.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    jQuery(function(){
        //call your function here
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not sure if I helping or I don't understand the question. I am sorry</p>
