<p>Remember, every cell inside the table view is reusable, that means, when you scroll up or down, the cells off the screen may be enqueued and removed from table view, and then added in to current view port of table view, that's also the reason why you should remember the status for specific row and configure your cell very time in the <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code>. So, the solution for your issue here is, when changing the segmentedControl's selected index, your should remember it, and then assign it in the <code>-tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code>.</p>
