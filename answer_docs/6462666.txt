<p>If I understand your question, you want to update all of the guest records where they match the main.ID.  You should be able to do this without an inner join, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE guest   
  SET guestMeal ='$guestMeal', guestNotes = '$guestNotes', 
      guestAccept = '$guestAccept' 
  WHERE guest.mainID ='$id'
</code></pre>

<p>This will update all of the guest records who are linked to your main record ID.</p>
