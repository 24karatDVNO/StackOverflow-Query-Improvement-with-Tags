<p>I was trying to do the same thing and ended up writing a python script to do it for me.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/bawigga/spy" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bawigga/spy</a></p>

<p>usage:</p>

<pre><code>$ ./spy myscript.py
... your script output ...

$ ./spy --help
Usage: spy [OPTIONS] [WATCH]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -c, --clear           clear the screen after each execution
  -e COMMAND, --exec=COMMAND
                        path to the program to execute
  -i INTERVAL, --interval=INTERVAL
                        (in seconds) set the time interval to check for file
                        modifications
</code></pre>
