<p>You're calculating your oauth_signature incorrectly.  A common pain point is not including oauth_verifier in your oauth request, as per the <a href="http://oauth.net/core/1.0a/#signing_process" rel="nofollow">Oauth 1.0a specification</a>.  </p>

<p>Since you didn't provide any code, nor any libs that you're using, I'm unable to validate what you're doing.</p>
