<p>On Dom Ready is something that was --mostly-- developed for a certain browser that doesn't follow the "rules"  (in case you're wondering, it starts with an I and ends with an E)  Dom ready helps with other things as well, but bottom line is that you can most often get away without it, especially since IE6 is finally on its way out.  </p>

<p>Try it out, test widely as you should be doing anyway, and if you're happy with the results, run with it.  This is one of the things that there's no set standard for.  Quite a bit of my company's legacy Javascript (including several instances of Tiny that are about to be deprecated) has been running in production without dom listeners for 2+ years without issue.</p>
