<p>The second article you're referencing explains how to use a callback function to record someone clicking on the +1 Button in Google Analytics. It's using event tracking so you should be able to pull the <code>ga:eventAction</code> dimension and <code>ga:totalEvents</code> metric from the Data Export API (see <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataDeveloperGuide.html" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataDeveloperGuide.html</a>). The current number of +1's for a site should be the total events where the event action was set to 'on' minus the total events where the event action was set to 'off'.</p>

<p>You'll need to add a filter to the extract so it only pulls out events with the <code>ga:eventCategory</code> of 'plusone'. You will probably also want to add the <code>ga:pagePath</code> dimension so you can split the results by page instead of the whole site.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that the results might not match up perfectly with what's recorded on the site. If the site has already received some +1 votes before the event tracking is implemented then they will be missing from your count. Also, tracking is never perfect so some button clicks will occasionally be missed.</p>
