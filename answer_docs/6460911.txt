<p>I am running into the same problem (the CarLot example in Chapter 11 of Hillegass, right?)</p>

<p>The following blog entry is from a developer who wrote and maintains an extension for use with NSManagedObjects and considers this a bug in XCode 4 and has filed a report in rdar : <a href="http://danieltull.co.uk/blog/2011/04/20/xcode-4-and-creating-nsmanagedobject-subclasses/" rel="nofollow">http://danieltull.co.uk/blog/2011/04/20/xcode-4-and-creating-nsmanagedobject-subclasses/</a></p>

<p>I have a machine with XCode 3 on it, I will eventually give up beating on this in 4, create the project in XCode 3 and import it into XCode 4.</p>

<p>Edited to add: Adding the element in XCode 3 and linking the outlet, and then importing the project into XCode 4 works fine, it does seem that this is a bug in XCode 4.  I do not get validation problems from XCode 4 doing this.</p>
