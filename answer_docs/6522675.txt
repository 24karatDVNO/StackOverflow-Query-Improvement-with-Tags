<p>I don't know why that doesn't work (it doesn't work for me either, I just tried), but it is very simple to do via a dynamic action with the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>Event = click</li>
<li>Selection Type = DOM Object</li>
<li>DOM Object = submit_button</li>
<li>"True" Action = Execute Javascript Code</li>
<li>Fire on page load = (unchecked)</li>
<li>Code = alert('hi');</li>
</ul>
