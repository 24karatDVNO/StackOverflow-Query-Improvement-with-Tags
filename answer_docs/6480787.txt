<p>Both initializing on instantiation and later are valid.  The real questions are what restrictions are you dealing with, what might fail at some point, when will you need to access the state and will you be able to work with a potential delay waiting until you need to access the state to compute the state.   Neither is right or wrong unless your situation calls for the other.</p>
