<p>When you submit, save the values in appropriately named $_SESSION members.  Then on your page, if you can't find the members in $_GET/$_POST, you can choose to look them up in $_SESSION.  Or vice versa.  Every time the user submits a form though, you should always update $_SESSION so that the values are the most current.  (in case they backtrack, or resubmit, or whatnot).</p>
