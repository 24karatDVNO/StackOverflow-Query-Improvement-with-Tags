<p>No, i tried it with emptying the div and redraw the complete diagram with jqPlot. That doesn't help either.
I did it like this:</p>



<pre class="lang-js prettyprint-override"><code>$('#diagramContainer').empty();
targetPlot = $.jqplot('#diagramContainer',
    toDraw, diagramOptions);
</code></pre>

<p>Doing this lots of times with many data leads also to memory leaks.</p>
