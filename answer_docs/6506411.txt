<p>Manager is a subclass of Field - that's why it's returned as a field by the GridFieldManager, from what I can decipher in your post you're attempting to get around the fact that you can't assign a change listener to a Manager... why would you ever want to do that anyway? Maybe go back to the basics of fields and managers and you'll see an easy way of doing what you're trying.</p>
