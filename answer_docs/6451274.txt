<p>Some argue that it's best practice is to combine all scripts in a single script block or a single script file, load only the javascript that is really needed and load it as late as possible to not slow down the rendering of html.</p>

<p>Apart from that i am sure that using a single script block loads faster than using multiple script blocks since they have to be evaluated individually. However this difference might not be recognizable.</p>
