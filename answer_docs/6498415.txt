<p>Can you simplify your program into something that I can run?  I tried something very simple and I was able to have it run both on the command line and inside Eclipse.</p>

<p>Here's the script I created:</p>

<p>import jline.ConsoleReader</p>

<p>def reader = new ConsoleReader()
   LOOP: while (true) {
        def input = reader?.readLine().trim()</p>

<pre><code>    if (input.length() == 0)
        continue

    if (["exit", "quit"].contains(input.tokenize().get(0)))
        break LOOP

    println "You said: " + input
}
</code></pre>

<p>Can you try running this and see if this works for you?</p>
