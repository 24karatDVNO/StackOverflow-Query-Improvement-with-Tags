<p>I think the FoodId is of Integer type in the database but over here in the query you have passed as string so convert the string to integer.</p>

<pre><code>cmd.CommandText = "select FoodName, Price from tablename where FoodID = '" + int.Parse(txtId.Text) + "' " ;
</code></pre>

<p>There seems to be no problem with this line of code :</p>

<pre><code>OleDbDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader();// correct way
</code></pre>
