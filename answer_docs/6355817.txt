<p>I think you asked why you should use ? super UTF-STRING instead of ? extends UTF-STRING.
If this is the question you can also use a Identifiable when declaring z.
Person and Tourist implement it so you can use it for both.
Honestly I think that a Tourist should extend a Person, because all the Tourists are Persons (in lexical meaning) so I'd declare </p>

<p>public class Person implements Identifiable  { . . . }</p>

<p>public class Tourist extends Person { . . . }</p>

<p>Person z = null;
if ( . . . ) {
     z = new Person ( ) ;
} else {
    z = new Tourist ( ) ;
}
z.setId(new UTFString(â€¦))</p>
