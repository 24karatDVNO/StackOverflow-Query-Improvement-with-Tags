<p>In difference to javacript, in PHP not everything is an object. Therefore you need to differ between function and class.</p>

<p>If you want to create an object, you need to <em>define</em> the class first.</p>

<pre><code>class myClass {
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can then add as many functions to the class as you need. But you need to <em>define</em> them first:</p>

<pre><code>class myClass {
  function test() {
    echo "test!\n";
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When everything is ready, you can bring it to life then:</p>

<pre><code>$class = new myClass;
$class-&gt;test();
</code></pre>
