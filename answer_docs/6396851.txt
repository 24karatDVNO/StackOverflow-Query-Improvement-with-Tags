<p>Calling <code>__syncthreads()</code> for some and not all threads can cause a deadlock. <code>threadIdx.x &lt; 10</code> calls <code>_syncthreads()</code>
As previously mentioned you are not using shared memory here.
The compiler is clever if you are not using the value afterwards the memory location can become invalid.
Try outputing the value as your return value for your device function. Should work fine especially if you move/remove <code>__syncthreads()</code>.</p>
