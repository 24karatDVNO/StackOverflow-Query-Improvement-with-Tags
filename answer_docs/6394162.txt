<p>Ok, I got it to work. All that was missing was <code>format.js</code> under the <code>format.html</code> in show in the games controller. Like this:</p>

<pre><code> def show
    @user = User.find(params[:id])
    @gameid = Game.find(params[:id])
    @features = Feature.paginate(:page =&gt; params[:page], :per_page =&gt; 8, :conditions =&gt; {:game_id =&gt; @gameid})
    @feature = Feature.new
         respond_to do |format|
           format.html
           format.js
    end
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I guess the strange thing is that games didn't need this to execute ajax...</p>

<p>Cheers guys for the help</p>
