<p>The format of the Message member of the DirectoryNotFoundException thrown from most Directory class methods is "Directory 'input' not found.". It shouldn't be hard to extract the input from this string.</p>

<p>Question thou, why would you need to get the input parameter from the exception if you're the one invoking the method with that exact parameter?</p>
