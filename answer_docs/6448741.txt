<p>Floating point numbers on your platform cannot exactly represent numbers which do not have a finite binary expansion, so you will naturally have uncertainty when using those numbers. Use rationals instead and keep "0.1" as "1/10" when possible.</p>

<p>("Finite binary expansion" means "finite sum of powers of two". 1/5 is not a finite sum of powers of 2, and neither is 1/3 nor 1/10.)</p>
