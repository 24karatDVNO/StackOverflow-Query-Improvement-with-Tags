<pre><code>SELECT p.page_id, COUNT( key_id ) AS keyword_all
FROM PAGES p
JOIN KEYWORDS ON key_page_id = page_id
GROUP BY page_id
HAVING keyword_all = (
  SELECT COUNT( key_id ) AS found_k
    FROM KEYWORDS
    WHERE key_page_id = p.page_id
      AND (
      key_name = 'purz'
      OR key_name = 'puzy'
    )
  )
</code></pre>

<p>What I did here is to get only pages which total number of keywords match the keywords that we look for.</p>

<p>This way you do not need to join multiple times. Only change the WHERE condition in the subquery according to the keywords that you look for.</p>
