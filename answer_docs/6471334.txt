<p>So, got it solved.</p>

<p>The discrepancies between my dev environment and the production server led to the need to double-escape a special character that .NET is fine with but my external program interprets specially.  The entire problem was unrelated to the handler.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, though.</p>
