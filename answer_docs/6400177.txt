<p>There are two common ways how people are doing rich text editing on iOS right now:</p>

<ol>
<li>UIWebView plus JavaScript</li>
<li>Custom View implementing UITextInput for input and CoreText for rendering</li>
</ol>

<p>But both are quite involved. Unfortunately Apple seems to have left out selection mechanics from UITextInput, so you would have to program all of this yourself.</p>
