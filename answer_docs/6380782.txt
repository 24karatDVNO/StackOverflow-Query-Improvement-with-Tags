<p>According to ios api, the method "startVideoCapture" gives a boolean return value</p>

<p><strong>Yes</strong> means it is recording</p>

<p><strong>No</strong> means one of the followings:</p>

<ol>
<li>Movie capture is already in progress</li>
<li>The device does not support movie</li>
<li>capture The device is out of disk space</li>
</ol>

<p>[Reference: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIImagePickerController_Class/UIImagePickerController/UIImagePickerController.html]</p>

<p>So as long as 'startRecording' is returning a Yes, you can almost certainly say it is recording.  Of course, to check that, you can always manually define your own call back with NSTimer (although previously there was abit of a hot debate bout its accuracy.)</p>
