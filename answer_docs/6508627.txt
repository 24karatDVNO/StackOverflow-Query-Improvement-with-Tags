<p>Thank you everyone for the input. </p>

<p>I fixed my problem, though I do not exactly understand why it worked.</p>

<p>I had the taxDataSet property of TotalTaxResult set up as a DataContract, but I did not end up using it. Simply taking out the taxDataSet property fixed my issue completely. I'm sure there is a rule of XML Serialization that I'm missing. Any explanation to prevent a repeat issue would be great.</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>
