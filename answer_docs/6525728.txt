<p>I started programming in Linux just two weeks back, before that i was always programming in Windows.</p>

<p>Theres no difference, except if you use any Specific IDE, i use PHP Storm and that was available in linux as well so its almost the same.</p>

<p>Also you will need to get used to with some Shell commands to get used to it, but without starting you wont learn anything. just install a ubuntu along with windows and you will get fluent very soon. now i hardly open windows :)</p>
