<p>Basically, nothing in your library's manifest is used when building the application. Even the package name is ignored. (This actually causes problems if you define custom attributes in XML and need to use an application namespace to reference the attributes in other XML. You have to copy the XML files into the application project and change the xmlns declaration to match the application's package name.)</p>
