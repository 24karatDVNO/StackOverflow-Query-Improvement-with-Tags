<p>I know you got it, but just as a tip... (too big for a comment)</p>

<p>Check the return value of <code>strdup()</code> for <code>NULL</code> and <code>free()</code> those pointers when you are done with them. If you don't memory will leak (it is leaking in your current code).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The strdup() function shall return a pointer to a new string, which is a duplicate of the string pointed to by s1. <strong>The returned pointer can be passed to free()</strong>. A null pointer is returned if the new string cannot be created.</p>
