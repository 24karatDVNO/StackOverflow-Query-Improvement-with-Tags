<p>Think of it as a matter of where the filtering happens. </p>

<p>When you specify a <code>where</code> clause you filter input rows to your aggregate function (ie: I only want to get the average age on persons living in a specific city.) When you specify a <code>having</code> constraint you specify that you only want a certain subset of the averages. (I only want to see cities with an average age of 70 years or above.)</p>
