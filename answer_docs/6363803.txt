<p>I think what you really want to do here is change your submit button a bit. Usually you would have <code>name="submit"</code>, if you changed to that, you should be able to change the id to anything you want. The only reason this wouldn't work is if your using the id attribute in order to do something with some js onmousedown somewhere else?</p>
