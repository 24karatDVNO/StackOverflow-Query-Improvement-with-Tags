<p>I'm not sure whether this is actually achievable but as stated above, i'd seriously reconsider the way it is being implemented, as anybody could call functions by simply typing them into their browser URL.</p>

<p>Imagine - <code>localhost/?delete_user_from_db()</code></p>

<p>Happy to help if you need more advice on how to change what you are trying to do.</p>
