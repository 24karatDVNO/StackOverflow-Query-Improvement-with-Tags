<p>I would personally re-write that as follows:</p>

<pre><code>// listen to every click on a checkbox
$('input[type="checkbox"].status').click(function(e){
    e.stopPropagation();

    // if the checkbox is checked
    if($(this).is(':checked')){
        // increase counter
        statusCounter++;
    }else{
        // decrease counter
        statusCounter--;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It shouldn't alter the functionality at all, but it may help simplify things and make finding the problem a little easier.</p>

<p>I also noticed that it isn't a complete piece of code. You are missing <code>});</code> at the end. Could you provide all of your JS? It may be a different piece of script that is causing the problem.</p>
