<p>I would solve this by creating a function:</p>

<pre><code>void MoveInfo(const Astm &amp;t, ReBar &amp;bar);
</code></pre>

<p>But to do that you would need to have the struct names provided properly:</p>

<pre><code>struct Astm { ... };
struct ReBar { ... };
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the position of the struct name.</p>
