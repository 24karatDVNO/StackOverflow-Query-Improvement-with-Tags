<p>One way to make these requests is to make an HTTP request passing the appropriate webservice XML in the body of the request. We need to do this regularly with Salesforce.com as it's relatively limited with regards to the WSDLs that it can consume, and so we need to find an easy way to see what the contents of those requests should be. Since you've written the webservice I assume you know what you need to send to it, but if not <a href="http://www.soapui.org" rel="nofollow">SoapUI</a> is an invaluable tool — it can consume WSDLs and generate example requests which you can then fill in and fire off to test the webservice also. For Java in particular, you'll want to find the WSDL2Java tool to generate classes you can use to call the service with ease.</p>
