<p>You have to do it manually (that is, unless you want to explicitly end the application).  As you said, the library is still in memory, until it is destroyed, and as far as I am aware, there is no way in c to cause data to be spontaneously reinitialised like that, at least not without some very ugly hacking, which would probably end up being more work then just doing it by hand.</p>
