<p>Are you sure InnerHtml is a read only property?</p>

<p>The HTMLAgility pack's documentation says otherwise: (Cut &amp; Paste)</p>

<pre><code>Gets or Sets the HTML between the start and end tags of the object.

Namespace:  HtmlAgilityPack
Assembly:  HtmlAgilityPack (in HtmlAgilityPack.dll) Version: 1.4.0.0 (1.4.0.0)
Syntax
C# 
public virtual string InnerHtml { get; set; }
</code></pre>

<p>If it is read only could you post some code?</p>
