<p>Did you write this Ejbexception class yourself? If so, that's a poor choice of name, because there's already a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/ejb/EJBException.html" rel="nofollow">javax.ejb.EJBException</a> in the library. However, it will work: when you throw it, the container will transport it to the client, who can then catch it. The string you inserted will be available from the exception's <code>getMessage()</code> method, just like normal.</p>

<p>If you're actually throwing a javax.ejb.EJBException here, then things are slightly different. That exception is aimed at the container, not the client. I actually don't know how it's made visible to the client. My suggestion would be to switch to using a custom exception, which the container will then pass to the client.</p>
