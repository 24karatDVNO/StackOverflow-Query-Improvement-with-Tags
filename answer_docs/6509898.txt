<p>Simple, you store the timestamp of when the student first started the test and output it to each page. Then it's a simple matter of substracting current time from that timestamp to get elapsed time. </p>

<p>However, depending on Javascript is a very bad way of ensuring that this timer gets started. A better method is to force the user to click on an actual link/button, WITHOUT involving Javascript. You record the timestamp on the server then that hit comes in, and after that everything's fine.</p>

<p>start.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a href="page1.php"&gt;Start Test - Page 1&lt;/a&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>page1.php:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

if(!isset($_SESSION['test_start_timestamp')) {
    $_SESSION['test_start_timestamp'] = time();
}
?&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Question #1&lt;/h3&gt;
etc...
</code></pre>

<p>The important thing is to never reset the timestamp value in the session once it's been set. Otherwise the test taker can simply click around until they reach a page where the counter's reset, and they can get more time for the test.</p>
