<p>The answer to your question is "Yes", you need to import ~/OSI to /home/SVN/repo first.</p>

<p>After you import that folder into SVN repository, then you can blow away your OSI directory and checkout a fresh workspace from the repository and continue with your next step.</p>

<pre><code>% svn import ~/OSI file://home/SVN/repo/trunk
% rm -rf ~/OSI
% svn co file://home/SVN/repo/trunk/OSI
% cd ~/OSI
</code></pre>
