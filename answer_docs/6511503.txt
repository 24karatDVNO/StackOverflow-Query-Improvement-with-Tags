<p>With TFS API, you may be able to get to that data.  Each changeset has a commiter.  I would take the code offered up <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/tfsversioncontrol/thread/3bd217c0-0981-4c79-b8ed-a48c4b33b596/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  From this, you can add:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var change in cs.Changes)
{
    if (change.Item.ServerItem != serverItem)
    {
        return;
    }
    //Get commiter
    cs.Committer
</code></pre>

<p>While this doesn't get you 100% of the way there, it is at least a starting point.</p>
