<p>msgid is actuall 3 strings because of the strings delimiters of double quotation marks. So you could just:</p>

<pre><code>msgid = ""&lt;&lt;"We couldn't set up that account, sorry. Please try again, or contact an "&lt;&lt;"admin (link is above)."
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you want to take a long route:</p>

<pre><code>x = %q{}
  msgid = """We couldn't set up that account, sorry. Please try again, or contact an ""admin (link is above)."
  x &lt;&lt; msgid
  x.gsub!('"', '')
  msgid = ""
  msgid &lt;&lt; x
# Check
  puts x
</code></pre>
