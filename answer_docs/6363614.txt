<p>In your settings.py on your dev box that isn't logging, add something like this:</p>

<pre><code>import logging
logger = logging.getLogger("sentry.errors")
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
formatter = logging.Formatter("[%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s")
handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(handler)
</code></pre>

<p>So assuming you're using the standard manage.py runserver on your development desktop, that will open a StreamHandler() which writes to standard error and you should see on your console.</p>

<p>You could also change StreamHandler() ---> FileHandler("/tmp/debug.log", "w")</p>

<p>The fact that it is logging to the sentry.errors handler says that there is a misconfiguration with your dev sentry configuration / settings.</p>
