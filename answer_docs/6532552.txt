<p>If I tell you to write 1/3 as decimal number down, you realize there a numbers which have no finite representation. .1 is the exact representation of 1/10 there this problem does not appear, BUT this is just in decimal representation. In binary representation .1 is one of those numbers that require infinite digits. As your number must be somehwere cut there is something lost.</p>
