<p>To answer your question, <code>line[0]</code> has the type <code>Line&amp;</code>, which can be read as a <code>reference to a Line object</code>. In C++, references cannot be <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>The error message in your question appears to be from a line of code that you have not posted. I can only speculate based on the error message that you are attempting to assign the value <code>0</code> to the line object located at index <code>i</code>. Because the <code>=</code> operator is not overloaded in your <code>Line</code> class, the compiler is unable to resolve the difference in types.</p>
