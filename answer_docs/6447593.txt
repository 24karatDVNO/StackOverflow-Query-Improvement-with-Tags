<p>I had a similar problem while learning about this subject on Django's docs. How I solved it was changing the format file that stored my fixture to the proper format. Originally, I saved the fixture was an ordinary text file with the name "test_db.json". Once I realized this, I changed the ".txt" file into a ".JSON" file. It began to load the fixture on its own once I typed in the "./manage.py test" command.</p>
