<p>So, Finally got this working right (or close enough to right).  As was mentioned in the comments from Brad, you should search your disk for PST files as well as what I have here.  This method ONLY affects PST files that the user has open in Outlook, and NOT all PST files on their computer.  What was happening was as I mentioned in my Edit, objOutlook.Session.RemoveStore was changing the value of objNS.Folders, which would break my first For loop.  You need to do this outside of your enumartion loop, otherwise it breaks and misses some (as well as mislabels some when remapping them).  Also, outside of that loop objFolder needed to be redefined as a MAPIFolder object, or else you get the Type Mismatch errors when trying to remove  Working sample is:</p>

<pre><code>' Enumerate PST filesand build arrays
objTextFile.Write("Enumerating PST files" &amp; vbCrLf)
For Each objFolder in objNS.Folders
If GetPSTPath(objFolder.StoreID) &lt;&gt; "" Then
    count = count + 1
    pstFiles = GetPSTPath(objFolder.StoreID)
    pstName = objFolder.Name
    pstFolder = objFolder
    objTextFile.Write(count &amp; "  " &amp; pstFiles &amp; vbCrLf)
    ReDim Preserve arrNames(count)
    arrNames(count) = pstName
    ReDim Preserve arrPaths(count)
    arrPaths(count) = pstFiles
    'objOutlook.Session.RemoveStore objFolder
End If
Next

For Each pstName in arrNames
set objFolder = objNS.Folders.Item(pstName)
objNS.RemoveStore objFolder
Next
set objFolder = Nothing
</code></pre>
