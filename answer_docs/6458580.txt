<p>I sincerely believe that copy semantics should be provided automatically, or not at all.</p>

<p>However, badly written libraries may sometimes benefit from a manual copy constructor.</p>

<p>Note that the situation is very different in C++ (because copy semantics are usually <em>required</em> by the standard library !) than in C++0x, where my advice pretty much always applies.</p>
