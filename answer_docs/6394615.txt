<p>A variable <em>is</em> a piece of memory. Anything you can put data into, including functions, uses memory. Without memory, you can't run or use what you've declared before, because you would have forgotten it.</p>

<p>I'm inclined to think that the specifics of how much memory is used and how is implementation-specific, which is why we see the many different performance comparisons. Since V8 and Rhino are open source implementations of Javascript interpreters used in Chrome and Firefox respectively, go check them out if you want to find out the specifics.</p>
