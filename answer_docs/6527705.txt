<p>I assume you xxxx'd out your package name, and it does not show your package name, anywhere else in the stack trace.</p>

<p>From what @Mibollama says it's the C code thats crashing so your emulator is screwed.</p>

<p>Delete the emulator and recreate a new one.</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Test on a real device.</p>

<p>Be careful with your emulators if you have "load from image" and "save to image" ticked in the emulator config, once you have an error you will always have it unless you wipe the image.</p>

<p>In your case it looks like the emulators' code itself got into a muddle, so creating a whole new 1 is the best idea.</p>
