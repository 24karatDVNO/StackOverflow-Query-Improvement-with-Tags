<p>Check out your /etc/hosts configuration.
You have to mention master domain name and same for slave.</p>

<p>For eg:
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
107.108.206.64  master ABC-ubuntu
107.108.208.24  slave  XYZ-ubuntu
107.108.87.81   slave1 QWE-ubuntu</p>

<p>Because during reduce processing , it search for XYZ-ubuntu host name instead of slave.</p>

<p>Also, your hosts config should be same in all. </p>
