<p>From the Team Explorer UI, I don't believe there is a way to find a build by WI.  </p>

<p>Using TFS API, I am sure you could build up a query to do this.  I know how to get all changesets that are associated with a WI and from there I am sure you can build it up to find all builds associated with a changeset.</p>
