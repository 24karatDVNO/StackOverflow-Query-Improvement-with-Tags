<p>All (or almost all) RDMS are optimized for set-based operations, not row-based. For the most of the cases set-based solution overperforms row-based. For example, even <code>SELECT * FROM table1</code> will perform many times faster than doing the same with cursors. However, there are some cases when cursor solution performs better. For example, calculating running aggregates using set-based approach in some RDMS(namely, SQLServer 2005) involves rescaning data several times, whereas cursor-based does it just once.<br>
   Another case when you need to use cursors is when the business logic of your application requires you to deal with each row individually.</p>
