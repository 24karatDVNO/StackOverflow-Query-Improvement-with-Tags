<p>Good question - My view would probably be that as long as it makes things easier it's useful.  You can always fork devise on github and put your customisation in there to some extent - which is what I've done on one project.  I'm also a bit nervous about rolling my own authentication when it can be so important to get it right, especially if other people want to see stuff they shouldn't.  But I'll be interested to see what others think.</p>
