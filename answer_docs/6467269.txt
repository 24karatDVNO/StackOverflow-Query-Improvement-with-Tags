<p>The Python equivalent of your Java Class with a main method would be:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass:
    def main(self):
        print("in main")
        doThings()
</code></pre>

<p>You create an instance and call its method:</p>

<pre><code>mc = MyClass()
mc.main()
</code></pre>

<p>I think the confusion is that you are using a main() function for your program, which isn't necessary, but is good practice. But your code seems fine.</p>
