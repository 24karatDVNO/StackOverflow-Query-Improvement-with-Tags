<blockquote>
  <p>My question is Write an SQL query that
  will determine which is the least
  expensive venue that will accommodate
  120 people.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In SQL Server I would use <code>select top 1... order by</code></p>

<pre><code>select top 1 v.venuename, v.costperday
from venues v 
where v.venuecapacity = 120
order by v.costperday 
</code></pre>

<p>Goggling a bit I found this syntax for MySQL and Oracle that looks like they will work but untested by me.</p>

<p>MySQL</p>

<pre><code>select v.venuename, v.costperday
from venues v 
where v.venuecapacity = 120
order by v.costperday 
limit 1
</code></pre>

<p>Oracle</p>

<pre><code>select v.venuename, v.costperday
from (select v.venuename, v.costperday
      from venues v 
      where v.venuecapacity = 120
      order by v.costperday
     )
where rownum = 1
</code></pre>
