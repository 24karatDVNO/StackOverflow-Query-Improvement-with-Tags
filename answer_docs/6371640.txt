<p>you can use cross apply</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM tblUsers as u CROSS JOIN tblProgrammes p
CROSS APPLY
(SELECT TOP 1 dateExpired FROM tblUserRepeatHistory
WHERE userId = u.id and programmeId = p.id
ORDER BY dateExpired desc
) as rr
</code></pre>

<p>in the co-related sub query you get the maximum dateExpired in tblUserRepeatHistory where meet the programme and the user,
cross apply is something like inner join, for nested queries and table-valued functions </p>
