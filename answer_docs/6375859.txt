<p>Assuming you're showing and hiding using the jQuery mechanisms, you might try using the <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery" rel="nofollow">Live Query</a> plugin.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Live Query also has the ability to
  fire a function (callback) when it
  matches a new element and another
  function (callback) for when an
  element is no longer matched.</p>
