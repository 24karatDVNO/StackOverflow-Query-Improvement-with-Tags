<p>Does the first row of your file (CSV (delimiter is comma) or TSV (delimiter is tab)) hold the 'column' names?
Do all rows have the same number of values (if necessary, with missing or null values being designated by consecutive delimiters)?</p>

<p>If the answers to both questions are in the affirmative, one option is to use ADO with the JET 4.0 driver to read each file as a relational data source.</p>

<p>There are plenty of samples that demonstrate the technique. Start <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms974559.aspx" rel="nofollow">here.</a></p>
