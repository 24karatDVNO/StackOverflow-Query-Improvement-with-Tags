<p>This should work out-of-the-box if you haven't done any crazy things to your OS X install. What I suggest:</p>

<ol>
<li>Try  reinstalling the Developer Tools from scratch.</li>
<li>Create a new user in OS X, log in and try installing RVM there in the normal fashion</li>
</ol>

<p>Since your RVM installation is only for your 'tl' user trying out RVM with a brand new user gives you a bit of a clean start. If installing RVM + Ruby 1.9.2 fails with the new user as well then I suggest reinstalling your machine since there's probably too much going on.</p>
