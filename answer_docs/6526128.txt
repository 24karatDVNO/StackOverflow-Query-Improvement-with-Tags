<p>I asked this a while ago.  Mysql doesn't do this unfortunately.  I'd love it to, but it just doesn't.  In php you could do it.  Example:</p>

<pre><code>public function random_id_gen($length)
    {
        //the characters you want in your id
        $characters = '23456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZ';
        $max = strlen($characters) - 1;
        $string = '';

        for ($i = 0; $i &lt; $length; $i++) {
            $string .= $characters[mt_rand(0, $max)];
        }

        return $string;
    } 
</code></pre>
