<p>$().click(handler)  will bind an event handler to the selected elemets from the DOM hierarchy. In your case the OK button is not part of the DOM yet, since it will be loaded asynchronously (AJAX).</p>

<p>There are two solutions here. Either have your handler binding code executed after the AJAX loading has complete or use jQuery's .live() <a href="http://api.jquery.com/live/" rel="nofollow">[docs]</a>.</p>
