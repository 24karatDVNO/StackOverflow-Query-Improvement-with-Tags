<p>Good question, one I should've asked before setting up SharePoint. I recall wishing I had installed VS prior to SharePoint, and the database has to exist for SharePoint to use, so I would recommend:</p>

<p>1.) Office
2.) Visual Studio
3.) SQL Server
4.) SharePoint</p>

<p>Also, you have the advantage of Windows 7. Create a step-named restore point before each installation (it will save you loads of trouble if you have to back up). In fact, if I were in your position I'd create a restore point and try the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=23415" rel="nofollow">Easy Setup Script</a> they link in that MSDN article. Good luck, hope it helps.</p>
