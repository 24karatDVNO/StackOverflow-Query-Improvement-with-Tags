<p>If you want to get all products of a catalogue, you just have to use the <strong>getProduct()</strong> method of a catalogue instance. </p>

<p>For example, if you want to get all catalogues with all products:</p>

<pre><code>$catalogues = Doctrine::getTable('catalogue')-&gt;findAll();

foreach($catalogues as $catalogue){
   //$catalogue is an instance
   echo $catalogue-&gt;getCatalogueName()

   //you've got all products from a catalogue instance    
   foreach($catalogue-&gt;getProduct() as $product){
       echo $product-&gt;getProductDesc();
   }
}
</code></pre>
