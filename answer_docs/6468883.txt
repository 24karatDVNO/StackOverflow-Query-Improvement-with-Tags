<p>You actually might save some time from the fact that you can drop the temp tables at the end instead of deleting rows (you said you had multiple users so you have to delete rather than truncate). Deleting is a logged operation and can add considerable time to the process. If the permanent tables are indexed, then create the temp tables and index them as well. I would bet you would see an increase in performance usless your temp db is close to out of space. </p>

<p>Table variables also might work but they can't be indexed and they are generally only faster for smaller datasets. So you might try a combination of temp tables for the things taht will be large enough to benfit form indexing and table varaibles for the smaller items. </p>

<p>An advatage of using temp tables and table variables is that you guarantee that one users process won;t interfer with another user's process. You say they currently havea way to identify which records but all it takes is one bug being introduced to break that when using permanent tables. Permanent table for temporary processing are a very risky choice. Temp tables and table variabels can never see the data from someone else's process and thus are far safer as a choice.</p>
