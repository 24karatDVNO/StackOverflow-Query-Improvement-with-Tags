<p>You might want to see whether the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/profile2" rel="nofollow">Profile 2</a> module might be able to help you. The writer role would then have permission to create a profile for all to see while others do not. Also, you could modify the way users list other users' profiles. You could use the Views module use a filter so that it only shows users of a certain role</p>
