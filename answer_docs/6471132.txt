<p>Storing session data in cookies exposes that data, and possibly some inner-workings of your code, to anyone with access to the user's computer as well as men-in-the-middle. Even when encrypted, I don't like the idea. Also, I think a session would be easier lost if contained only in cookies, as many users dump cookies and associated history information fairly often. With a robust server side storage mechanism, the session data is more stable, IMO.</p>
