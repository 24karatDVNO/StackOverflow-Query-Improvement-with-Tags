<p>You can see the error by using the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$output = exec("$gpg -e -r $recipient $secret_file 2&gt;&amp;1", $out); 
echo "&lt;pre&gt;$output&lt;/pre&gt;";
</code></pre>

<p>this will guide you.</p>

<p>possible problem to look at:</p>

<ul>
<li>the file you are trying to encrypt is not in the right path..</li>
<li>GnuPG is trying to write to the /root/.gnupg directory with "apache" as a user. Obvisouly this is not possible unless you change you access rights to this dir (not recommended).</li>
<li>you don't have the right access to the GnuPG root dir (where ever it is)</li>
<li>you don't have WRITE in the dir apache is trying to create the new file..</li>
</ul>

<p>Let me know what your code outputs and I'll be able to help. I ran into this already, it is tedious.</p>
