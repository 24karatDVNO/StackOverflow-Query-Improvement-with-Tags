<p>Randolf's suggestion is indeed the best option.<br>
however, if you don't have access to an http server, you might want to use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/51ket42z%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">versioning</a> to differentiate between releases.<br>
that way you and your testers can easily see what version they're using (you can even display the assembly version info in the UI for convenience). </p>
