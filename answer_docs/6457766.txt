<p>If you really want to do that you can define some string constants:</p>

<p>You can then use it like a variable. Either give it a shorter name. Or give it the same name and code completion will take cars of the rest. </p>

<p>For example - in the implementation file:</p>

<pre><code>NSString * const nib1_blahblahblah = @"nib1_blahblahblah";
NSString * const nib2_blahblahblah = @"nib2_blahblahblah";
</code></pre>

<p>Is it worth me telling you that better nib names would be a better idea?</p>
