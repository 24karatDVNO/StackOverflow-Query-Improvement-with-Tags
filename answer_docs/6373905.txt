<p>The <code>indexOf</code> function can only take one string at a time. To do this you would need to have multiple clauses in your <code>if</code> statement, joined with <code>&amp;&amp;</code>:</p>

<p><code>if(cookieValue.indexOf('shopping') == -1 &amp;&amp; cookieValue.indexOf('pricegrabber') == -1)</code></p>

<p>You can add all of your conditions into that <code>if</code> statement. The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> means "if this and this" etc. etc.</p>
