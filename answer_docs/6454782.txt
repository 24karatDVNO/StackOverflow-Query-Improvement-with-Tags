<p>Always favor interface. You should try very hard to avoid abstract classes. With that being said abstract classes have a place especially in libraryish code akin to java collections. In these places you are building classes that are expressly designed for the purpose of being extended and there is a lot of value in consolidating behavior especially from a quality perspective.</p>
