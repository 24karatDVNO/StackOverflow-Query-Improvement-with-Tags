<p>Every android package has access to its resources, based off of its Context. If you need access to resources from an independent class, you must provide it a Context object so that it can use context.getResources().</p>

<p>There are ways to create a new context (so that you could, for example, get resources from it), however they require that you start with some valid context in the first place.</p>
