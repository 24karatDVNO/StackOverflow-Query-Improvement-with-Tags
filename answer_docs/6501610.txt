<p>I would suggest keeping a boolean value around which is set off when the first IBAction is fired. You could do something like this:</p>

<p>In your interface:</p>

<pre><code>BOOL questionWasAnswered;
</code></pre>

<p>When you set up your view, make sure to set it to <code>NO</code>. Then, in each IBAction, you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code> if(questionWasAnswered){
   return;
 }else{
    questionWasAnswered = YES;
 }

 //...Run the rest of your method
</code></pre>
