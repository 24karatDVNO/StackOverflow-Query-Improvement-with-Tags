<p>I'll assume that the possible different data types are known (otherwise how can the server possibly handle them). Then you could use a union, e.g. something like:</p>

<pre><code>union dataU{
    struct datatype1S datatype1;
    struct datatype2S datatype2;
    ...
}
struct messageS {
    int typeId;
    union dataU data;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then use the typeId to determine what member of the union to look at.</p>
