<p>While not strictly an answer to your question, the Github project CLIDE is a command line utility that simplifies creating and managing Visual Studio projects, and makes it easier to manage and build projects using only the compiler (csc.exe) and msbuild.exe . Use it to create a test project that does what you need, and you should be able to figure out the rest from the files it creates.</p>
