<p>Try this (untested) code and see if it does what you want. By the looks of it, it should return the same things and hopefully a bit faster.</p>

<pre><code>select Tdate = max(Industries.Date)    
from #ii_t i
  left outer join Industries
    on Industries.id = i.id and
       Industries.Date &lt;= '22 June 2011'
group by i.id
</code></pre>
