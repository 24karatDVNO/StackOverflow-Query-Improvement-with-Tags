<p>According to <a href="http://blog.faberacoustical.com/2009/iphone/iphone-microphone-frequency-response-comparison/" rel="nofollow">This Page</a>, I think you're out of luck. The built in mic seems to peak around 20KHz (give or take). This is to be expected though, as consumer-grade microphones aren't designed to, and therefore aren't likely to, pickup anything outside of the [general] range of human hearing (20Hz-20KHz). </p>
