<p>Another option would be using <a href="http://sputility.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">SPUtility.js</a> (full disclosure, I maintain this open source library). It depends on Prototype.js so you may not be interested since you are using jQuery.</p>

<p>It supports hiding and/or disabling many different field types.. including people pickers:</p>

<pre><code>// make a people field read only
SPUtility.GetSPField('Assigned To').MakeReadOnly();
// hide the people field
SPUtility.GetSPField('Assigned To').Hide();
</code></pre>
