<p>If you need EC2 instance(s) anyway (for web hosting for instance) then hosting MySQL on an EC2 instance that you are already paying for is going to be cheaper... </p>

<p>But as your load goes up I would definitely look towards RDS for easier scaling, reduced admin overhead, better disaster recover story, etc...  No reason in my opinion to host MySQL on dedicated EC2 instances...</p>
