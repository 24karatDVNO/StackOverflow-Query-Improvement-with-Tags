<p>You can't just search a function in a source because there are so many ways to obfuscate it.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>$f = 'fo'; //&gt; somewhere
$f .= 'pen'; //&gt; somewhere else

$f('hi');
</code></pre>

<p>Don't inject code that you cannot clearly understand its source and they are coming from untrasted sources.</p>
