<p>Make a variable named <code>$status</code> for example and and initialize it to 0, at each test assign to it 1 if there is an error, at the end check whether if it is equal to one, exit the script otherwise continue the execution. Or better make an array and for each test assign 0 or 1, depend in the test(the field is not empty assign one else zero) and later you can echo an error message to user indicating the missing fields.</p>
