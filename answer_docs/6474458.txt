<p>On some versions of IE this will work, but only because they are non-conforming.</p>

<pre><code>var fn  // declares a variable named fn
    = function  // initializes fn
      foo  // declares a name foo that is only visible within the function body.
      (){
        ...  // foo is visible here.
      };
foo();  // foo is not defined here (except on IE 6 and earlier)
fn();  // works just fine.
</code></pre>
