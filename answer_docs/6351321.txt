<p>I don't know how they have implemented that feature in their app. They are most likely just altering the View tree, i.e. replacing one View with another programmatically. The biggest problem with this is that you usually need a lot of code to support each of the Views that could be shown within a particular Activity -- code for loading data, handling user taps, etc. You could put a lot of that code inside a custom View class instead of having it in the Activity. If putting "business logic" inside a View seems perverse, then I would recommend using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Fragment.html" rel="nofollow">Fragments</a>. Then changing tabs can be handled using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/FragmentTransaction.html" rel="nofollow">FragmentTransactions</a>. These were added in Android 3.0, but there is a <a href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/03/fragments-for-all.html" rel="nofollow">compatibility package</a> that let's you use these on Android 1.6+.</p>
