<p>As suggested <a href="http://www.dotnetmonster.com/Uwe/Forum.aspx/winform-controls/5529/Programmatically-select-day-subfield-in-datetime-picker" rel="nofollow">here</a>, I don't think that's possible.</p>

<p>In that link is also suggested a tricky workaround (i.e. programmatically press the arrow to the right when the datetimepicker has got the focus) but that could lead to unexpected side-effects.</p>
