<p>I think it relates to the question: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/29/apple-location/" rel="nofollow">http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/29/apple-location/</a></p>

<p>For devices running iPhone OS versions 1.1.3 to 3.1, Apple relied on (and still relies on) databases maintained by Google and Skyhook Wireless (“Skyhook”) to provide location-based services. Beginning with the iPhone OS version 3.2 released in April 2010, Apple relies on its own databases to provide location-based services and for diagnostic purposes. </p>
