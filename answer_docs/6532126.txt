<p>Found the solution,</p>

<p>The issue was the web service which was residing as Http. However, when the reference was made, web.config defined the web service using the httpstransport method.</p>

<p>Changed the <code>httpstransport</code> method to <code>httptransportmethod</code> and it worked like charm.</p>
