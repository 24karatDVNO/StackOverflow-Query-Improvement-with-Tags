<p>Unless I misunderstand the question, to send your app to iTunes connect from Xcode4 you choose Product -> Archive from the menu. </p>

<p>If your certs and IDs are correct, and they seem to be, then you will be shown the Archives view in the Organizer. Select the recent Archive and choose Validate. </p>

<p>If it validates, choose Submit. Your app should be submitted to iTunes Connect.</p>
