<p>My very simple idea is...<br/></p>

<p>(1) Download log4j's source.<br/>
(2-a) Delete unused appender source.(ex. JDBCAppender.java)<br/>
(2-b) Delete xml package, if you not use xml function.<br/>
(2-c) Delete jmx package, if you not use jmx function.<br/>
(2-d) Delete chainsaw package, if you not use chainsaw function.<br/>
(2-e) Delete lf5 package, if you not use lf5 function.<br/>
(3) Delete generated error source.<br/>
(4) Export jar file.<br/></p>

<p>Maybe, you can get quarter megabyte jar file. * But it is not to confirm action! *</p>
