<p>My suggestion to you is to use RelativeLayout when laying down elements on your application page. Good starting point for this layout is in <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout-objects.html#relativelayout" rel="nofollow">this page</a>. Also, this layout allows you to do exactly what you want, using ALIGN_PARENT_TOP and ALIGN_PARENT_BOTTOM attributes for your images. One more advantage of this layout is that it will easily adjust to any screen size. On the other side, only disadvantage of this layout is that it can be sometimes tricky to fully understand it's behavior.</p>
