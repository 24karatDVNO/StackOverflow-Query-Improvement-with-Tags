<p>I had the same problem. In my case, the code was executed twice. I had the following situation:</p>

<p>In one app:</p>

<pre><code>from apps.accounts.models import User
</code></pre>

<p>And in another app:</p>

<pre><code>from accounts.models import User
</code></pre>

<p>Since the customization code was in the accounts/models.py module, it was executed twice.</p>
