<p>Security Considerations for Reflection
Reflection provides the ability to obtain information about types and members, and to access members. In Silverlight, you can use reflection to perform the following tasks: </p>

<p>Enumerate types and members, and examine their metadata.</p>

<p>Enumerate and examine assemblies and modules.</p>

<p>Access public members.</p>

<p>Access internal members (Friend members in Visual Basic) in the calling code's assembly. (In reflection, this is referred to as assembly-level access.)</p>

<p>In Silverlight, you cannot use reflection to access private types and members. If the access level of a type or member would prevent you from accessing it in statically compiled code, you cannot access it dynamically by using reflection. </p>
