<p>If you are really dedicated to receiving only the data that has changed you would have to do 4 things</p>

<ol>
<li>Version the xml</li>
<li>Have your JS periodically query the version number</li>
<li>if different JS then calls "updateFromCurrentVersion(currentVersion)" </li>
<li>updateFromCurrentVersion returns the changes </li>
</ol>
