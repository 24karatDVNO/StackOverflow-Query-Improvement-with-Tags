<p>Well, jtbandes pretty much said it already: a dynamic language needs to check the validity of the login and, certainly with login details, due to security reasons, you want to use server-side code, like PHP or ASP.</p>

<p>Having said that, it really seems pointless to make a dummy login, other than just building the HTML code. Unless you use AJAX to send the data to your web-server, rather than forwarding the user to a processing page, any and all code you put in for a 'dummy' will be a waste of time and will need to be removed later.</p>

<p>How will the page look different after login as it does before and what will cause this difference? An additional GET in the URL?</p>
