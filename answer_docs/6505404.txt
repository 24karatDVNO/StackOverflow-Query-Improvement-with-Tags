<p>The only thing you could do to avoid the unresponsive UI is to sort the items list on another thread (decoupled from the <code>ListView</code>) and when done call <code>ListView.Items.Clear</code> and <code>ListView.Items.AddRange</code> to add the sorted items to the <code>ListView</code>. Not sure if the infrastructural overhead of thread management and synchronization are worth the effort.</p>
