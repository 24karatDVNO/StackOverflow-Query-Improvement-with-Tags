<p>Well, you don't need regular expressions:</p>

<pre><code>def findline(search_string, file_name, offset=0):
    with open(file_name, 'r') as infile:
        infile.seek(offset)
        for line in infile
            if search_string in line:
               return line
</code></pre>

<p>(The above is actually just a combination of others' with the addition of file_name as a function param, and offset, meaning you can now traverse the file and get multiple incidences of your sought string).</p>
