<p>It can be done; the question is how ;-) If you really want to use multiple, parallel arrays, then you may have no choice but to subclass <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/BaseAdapter.html" rel="nofollow">BaseAdapter</a>. If you are using (or can use) an array of objects, you can do a somewhat simpler subclassing from <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html" rel="nofollow">ArrayAdapter</a>. In the latter case, I think the only method that you need to override is <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ArrayAdapter.html#getView%28int,%20android.view.View,%20android.view.ViewGroup%29" rel="nofollow">getView</a>.</p>
