<p>It seems to me that your problem may be with the spritely plugin for jQuery.  I set up a quick test at: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/Htm4y/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/Htm4y/</a>, that worked for me (in Chrome).  In the example, clicking the .nav links fires a jQuery toggle.  I would need to see your css to figure out what is supposed to be in that div, but it must be configured correctly in order for spritely to animate it.</p>
