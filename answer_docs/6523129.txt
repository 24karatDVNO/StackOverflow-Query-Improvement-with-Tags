<p>Android 3.1 is optimized for Tablets, while your application will run it may not function visually the same due to it being massively scaled up for a tablet sized screen. If you are unsure how it will look then set up the emulator included in the SDK and set it to the screen size/resolution of a tablet and see for yourself.</p>
