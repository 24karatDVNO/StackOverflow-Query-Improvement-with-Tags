<p>I'd make another layout for the iframe pages, something like <code>app/views/layouts/iframe.html.erb</code>, that doesn't have your usual headers and footers, may have different CSS, etc.</p>

<p>Then you just need to make your controller actions use that layout when rendering, as appropriate. You can do that when if you call render explicitly, like this:</p>

<pre><code>render "show", :layout =&gt; "iframe"
</code></pre>

<p>But it's probably simpler to set it at the controller level:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeController &lt; ApplicationController
    layout "iframe", :only =&gt; "show"
end
</code></pre>

<p>You could also put your logic for choosing the correct layout (whatever it is -- I'm assuming that isn't really the thrust of the question) into a method:</p>

<pre><code>class SomeController &lt; ApplicationController
    layout :current_layout

private
    def current_layout
        # Return the correct layout for the current request.
        params[:iframe] ? "iframe" : "application"
    end
end
</code></pre>
