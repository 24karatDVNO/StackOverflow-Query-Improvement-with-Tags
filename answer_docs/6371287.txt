<p>I think you're best off just overriding the styles of the graph elements. For example I moved the graph to the side by adding padding: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/MT22y/7/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/MT22y/7/</a> so that it isn't covering the axis any more.</p>

<p>You might need to play with the styles and widths a bit, but this is probably the easiest method.</p>
