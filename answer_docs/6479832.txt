<p>I'm not sure of this answer, but at least in most Linux distributions there are separate packages for libraries and "dev" libraries. The bare library package includes just the library -- that is, only what's needed to use the library once a program is built to need it -- whereas the "dev" version includes C headers and the other things necessary to build programs that use the library. Does Cygwin have something similar? If so, have you installed the "dev" versions of gobject, gthread, glib, etc.?</p>
