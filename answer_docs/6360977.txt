<p>While I appreciate Bavarious' and bbum's correction about the placement of the [super dealloc] that wasn't really my problem. In my actual code, I am calling the "releasing" code in a separate method. I placed it inline in dealloc here because I was trying to simplify my question and mistakenly pasted it in the wrong place.</p>

<p>I think the problem wasn't in code, but an environmental issue.  I brought the code over to a different machine and did not experiencing any problems.  I rebooted the original machine and it too is behaving correctly now.  I guess I was in a weird state or something.</p>
