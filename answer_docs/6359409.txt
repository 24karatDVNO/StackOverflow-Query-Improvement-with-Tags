<p>Buddy I had same problem (and asked here at StackOverflow), check it out <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6322559/whats-the-correct-name-for-guava-module-in-gwt-application">in this thread</a>. Hope that helps! And as Collin pointed out, you're having wrong import, don't use thirdpardy libraries from there.</p>
