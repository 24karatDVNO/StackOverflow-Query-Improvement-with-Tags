<p>If you have your sound file in mp3 format, you'll have to DECODE it, edit it programaticaly, and re-encode it later.</p>

<p>If by 'hide' you mean cut out, it is very simple in PCM world.  You'll just copy the samples that you need to the output buffer, omitting ones that you don't need.</p>

<p>If you plan to edit audio from code, you'll have to learn what is sample, how the audio is represented in the memory, and so on, anyway.</p>
