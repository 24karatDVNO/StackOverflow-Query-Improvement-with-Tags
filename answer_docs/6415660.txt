<p>How about using the google calendar API? google has support for recurring events of all kind and there's already a built in library in the zend framework.

<p>We tried doing a custom made recurring events as well, and gave up on that after it was too buggy. The editing event was a nightmare to develop. We're switching to this API as soon as we can.</p>
