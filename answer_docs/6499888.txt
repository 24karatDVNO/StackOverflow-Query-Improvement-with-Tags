<p>not sur eif this i what you are looking for but i saw this on a forum:</p>

<pre><code>b2BodyDef edgedef;
edgedef.position.Set(0.f,10.f);
b2Body* edge = world-&gt;CreateBody(&amp;edgedef);

b2Vec2 vertices[2];
vertices[0].Set(0.0f, 0.0f);
vertices[1].Set(10.0f, 0.0f);
int32 count = 2;

b2PolygonShape polygon;
polygon.Set(vertices, count);

b2FixtureDef edgefixtureDef;
edgefixtureDef.shape = &amp;polygon;

edge-&gt;CreateFixture(&amp;edgefixtureDef);
</code></pre>

<p>you could see how you could add more points by sending a larger  array </p>
