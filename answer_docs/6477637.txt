<p>Most likely is that <code>detailViewController</code> is nil. If you look at the console output it will tell you for certain. </p>

<p>The reason its nil on hardware is that the file system is case sensitive on hardware and hence</p>

<p><code>golfbaner *detailViewController = [[golfbaner alloc] initWithNibName:@"Golfbaner" bundle:nil];</code></p>

<p>"Golfbaner" != "golfbaner"</p>

<p>Check your nibname for case match. I suspect its "golfbaner.xib".</p>

<p>As a style point class names should be capitalised otherwise it makes a class hard to separate from a variable when reading code. </p>
