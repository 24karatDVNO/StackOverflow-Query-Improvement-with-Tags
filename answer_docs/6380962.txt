<p>Another way to do it, if you didn't want to use a User Defined Function would be to use the REPLACE function, like so:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT Phone, REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(Phone,' ',''),'(',''),')',''),'-','') AS NewPhone
FROM Contacts
</code></pre>

<p>Although its a bit klunky, it should serve your purpose.</p>
