<p>It sounds like IIS is recycling your service.  Keep this in mind (excerpted from Internet <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa751802.aspx" rel="nofollow">Information Services Hosting Best Practices</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The IIS hosting environment is
  optimized for services that do not
  maintain local state in memory. IIS
  recycles the host process in response
  to a variety of external and internal
  events, causing any volatile state
  stored exclusively in memory to be
  lost. Services hosted in IIS should
  store their state external to the
  process (for example, in a database)
  or in an in-memory cache that can
  easily be re-created if an application
  recycle event occurs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While it is possible to disable recycling, if you you need to be IIS-hosted and you care about state, you should probably put it in a durable location.</p>
