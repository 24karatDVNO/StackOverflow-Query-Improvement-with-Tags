<p>I guess you're using Firefox 4.0. There seems to be a bug in Firefox 4.0 regarding Flash and mouse-cursor (also affects <code>Mouse.hide()</code>). Apparently there's nothing you can do about it for now... Also have a look at this <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/questions/796828" rel="nofollow">Firefox help thread</a>.</p>
