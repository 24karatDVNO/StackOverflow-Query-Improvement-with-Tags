<p>In you example, the span is not 'next', it is a child node. You would use next if your html looked something like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;button class="button" type="button"&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;&lt;span&gt;Edit&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you want to get the text using html(), (as Bj√∂rn mentioned)</p>
