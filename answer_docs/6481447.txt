<p>A Semaphore is used to control the access to a critical section. Auto/ManualResetEvent is used when you want to signal other threads that a certain event has occurred so they can react on it - they have not really something to do with guarding the entry into a critical section. </p>

<p>I'm not sure which particular usage you refer to but I guess you could use locks and events to implement a semaphore so the answer to your question probably is no and yes depending on what you are after.</p>
