<p>My guess: on roll over you show a clip, that overlaps your button.
Hence, you get an immediate roll out on the button. 
Which in turn causes your button to recieve roll over again.
That causes a recursive stack overflow. :)</p>

<p>If the above holds true, just disable mouse on MySmiles. 
Both mouseChidren and mouseEnabled.</p>
