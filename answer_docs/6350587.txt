<p>What platform are you working on? And what language do you intend to use?</p>

<p>Adobe Air let's you embed a webkit inside an Air application and interact with the page JavaScript (there is two-way communication between the page JS and the AIR runtime).</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you are not bound to webkit you could take Mozilla Chromeless for a spin.</p>

<p>My apologies if none of this does what you need to do, I can't quite figure what exactly you are trying to do (page scraping? submitting forms?).</p>
