<p>I seems find the problem.
I have a view controller named "VCGameRule", under the MainView. And it has a declaration in the VCGameRule.h file as follow:</p>

<pre><code>@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *lblInitialCash;
</code></pre>

<p>In VCGameRule.m, there is a code as following in a initialization function:</p>

<pre><code>lblInitialCash = [[UILabel alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(135, 12, 50, 20)];
</code></pre>

<p>And its viewDidUnload function is like this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)viewDidUnload {
   [super viewDidUnload];
   // Release any retained subviews of the main view.
   self.lblInitialCash = nil; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>See the problem? I try to assign an new allocated UILabel object to lblInitialCash which is a retained IBOutlet property. And I try to release the property in viewDidUnload function, then some bad thing happens.... </p>

<p>I am still not sure what the exactly error it occurs. But I think should be the property's original allocated memory become chaos. So I receive a "EXC_BAD_ACCESS" error message when the App try to call didReceiveMemoryWarning in every loaded view controllers.</p>

<p>After I modify the IBOutlet property to a normal class variables, the error seems not happen again! And everything is fine now, even my App really uses a lot of memory and do many times of viewDidUnload function, App is still alive. \(^o^)/</p>
