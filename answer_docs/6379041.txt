<p>Neo4j as a standalone server has also REST API: <a href="http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api.html" rel="nofollow">http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/milestone/rest-api.html</a>, if you can embedded your requests in single REST queries, there is no need to use native embedded neo4j.  If there is no need to use the embedded neo4j, you can take any language of your choice. </p>

<p>Regarding the scalability, recently neo4j can be used on <a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2011/02/announcing-neo4j-on-windows-azure.html" rel="nofollow">Azure</a>, so it must be quite easy to scale.

<p>UPDATE: in the newest version of Neo4j, there is added the support for a new query language - <a href="http://blog.neo4j.org/2011/06/kiruna-stol-14-milestone-4.html" rel="nofollow">http://blog.neo4j.org/2011/06/kiruna-stol-14-milestone-4.html</a>.</p>
