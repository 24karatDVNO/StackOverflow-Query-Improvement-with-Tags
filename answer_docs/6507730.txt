<p>I was also encountered error when followed instructions, so i ran  "adb logcat" which showed that it is not able to find the class.</p>

<p>In the instructions(tutorial)  - : 
It has been said that during (create new project or class)application name as Hello World and activity name became HelloWorldActivity.</p>

<p>So if you maintain both CreateActivity name and application name both same, then it  might work.</p>

<p>I have increased the AVD RAM size to 1024 and VM application to 36 0r 48 or 24. </p>
