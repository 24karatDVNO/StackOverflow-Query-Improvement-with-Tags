<p>By looking around, I found the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1770312/is-there-a-sendkey-for-mac-in-python">answer to your question</a> in another question similar to yours.</p>

<p>You're going to have to change up the code a little bit so that it's 'Enter' not Ctrl-r, but it should be easy.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
