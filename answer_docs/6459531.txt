<p>You don't edit .class files.  It's the .java files that you edit and then compile into the .class files.  I am assuming that the .java files must be in there as well if you can view them and update.  Of course it is pointless to try to put the .java back in and export since the runtime will require the .class.</p>

<p>Of course, if it is EJB code inside an EAR, it is quite possible that it is either generated code, or code that will have to be run through an EJB compiler to produce a proper EJB.</p>
