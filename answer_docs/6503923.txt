<p>./share/locale/* includes the translations, so you have to choose yourself. Do you want to have translations or do you want to save disk space?
Depending on how you ship your application (for example simply packed in a .rar or with an installer), you can install those translations conditionally.
The only <em>required</em>  files are the libraries, like libgtk-x11-2.0.dll, libglib-2.0.dll, â€¦</p>
