<p>You should be using a Service instead of an activity to do background tasks. You can pass the password you obtain from the EditText to the Service as an extra in the Intent you use to start the Service.</p>

<p>The easiest way for you to do this would be to extend <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html" rel="nofollow">IntentService</a> and have your decryption there. Call the service in your button listener using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Context.html#startService%28android.content.Intent%29" rel="nofollow">startService</a>. At the end of you encryption, call the new activity using startActivity.</p>

<p>EDIT: I should clarify my answer. Rory is correct - AsyncTask should be used for background tasks within an Activity. The method to differentiate on whether a background task should use AsyncTask or Service should depend on whether or not the task should be executing if you exit the activity. For example, if I start the download of a file in the background of my Activity, and I want the download to continue even when I leave the Activity, you should use a Service. On the other hand, if it's a background task to publish the current wifi signal strength to be displayed in your Activity, use AsyncTask.</p>
