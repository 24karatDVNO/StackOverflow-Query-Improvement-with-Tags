<p>I am surprised not to find this one on the list as I use it all the time:</p>

<p><kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd>, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> - Implement method stub.</p>

<p>Write a call to a non-existent method, and then use that shortcut to create the method in the right place, with the right parameters and return value, but with a method body that just throws a NotImplementedException.</p>

<p>Great for top-down coding.</p>
