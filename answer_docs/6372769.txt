<p>I don't think is a good idea to pass variables from pages in post forms. Most likely you should make a good use out of sessions, paths and database.
What I'm trying to say is to save all info in a good structured database, every step has to be separated, that way you can always return to any step and load that step info from database without losing or breaking anything.</p>

<p>Since is an e-commerce website you can't afford to make a double payment or errors, since one single error can lead you into losing that client.</p>

<p>After finishing the forms you can save a field in database and tell other scripts to redirect the client on another page since he finished.</p>
