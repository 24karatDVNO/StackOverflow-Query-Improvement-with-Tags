<p>Did you populate the list? Try this:</p>

<pre><code>var games = new List&lt;Game&gt; {
                new Game { Name = "Foo Bros.", Players = 2, ReleaseYear = 1983 },
                new Game { Name = "Hope", Players = 4, ReleaseYear = 1993 }
            };
var firstFourPlayerGame = games.First(g =&gt; g.Players == 4);
Console.WriteLine(firstFourPlayerGame.Name);
</code></pre>

<p>Output:</p>

<p>Hope</p>
