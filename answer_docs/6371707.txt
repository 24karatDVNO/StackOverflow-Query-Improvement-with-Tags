<p>It's always a lively topic of debate, how to code. Whilst I agree that going overboard at anytime is a waste of time and energy, likely to show limited ROI, undertaking any and all coding with a professional attitude is a must. </p>

<p>As @john-yeates said so rightly, when you take the attitude of, "I'll come back to it later", later <em>never comes</em> as there will always be something else that is "<em>more important</em>" or "<em>more urgent and pressing</em>".</p>

<p>At the very least, even if your organisation doesn't have a formalised standard, what it does have, should be followed <em>consistently</em>, every time, by every developer in your organisation/company/not-for-profit; no matter how junior, intermediate, or senior they are.</p>

<p>There's no excuse for sloppy coding and it only hurts everyone later. At least, even if the quality of the code is poor or average, if it's consistently written, the time taken by new maintainers of it, or an existing maintainer returning to it after months away, it will take less time to understand and come up to speed on.</p>
