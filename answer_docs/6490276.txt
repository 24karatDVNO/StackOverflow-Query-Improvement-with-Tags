<p>I haven't tried, but it would be worth trying to use the NIO connector, via Jetty's <code>SslSelectChannelConnector</code>, with Restlet parameter <code>type=1</code>. (The <a href="http://www.restlet.org/documentation/2.0/jse/ext/index.html?org/restlet/ext/jetty/HttpsServerHelper.html" rel="nofollow">default</a> is to use the <code>SslSocketConnector</code>, with <code>type=2</code>.)</p>
