<p>Not sure that this would help, but you can try to use the following code to get dictionary and then work with it(write to files, compare and etc):</p>

<pre><code>res = {}
with open('c:\\tst.txt') as f:
    lines = f.readlines()
    for i,line in enumerate(lines):
        line = line.strip()
        if (i == 0 and line):
            key = line
            res[key] = []
        elif not line and i+1 &lt; len(lines):
            key = lines[i+1].strip()
            res[key] = []
        elif line and line != key:
            res[key].append(line)
print res
</code></pre>
