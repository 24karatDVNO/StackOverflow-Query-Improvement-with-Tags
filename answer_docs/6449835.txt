<p>I am developing with Windows 7, 64bit, django 1.3, py 2.6 and I always check functionality of the Dev server in IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome. My newest system has IE9 on it and my old system has IE8. I also noticed the hanging problem. I found that when I used 127.0.0.1:8000 it hung and would take refreshed to get it to work. If I started the Dev server using the specific IP address of my dev server the problem seemed to be gone. For example python manage.py runserver 192.168.1.134:8000 </p>

<p>Does seem to be something very specific to IE9. an if you google it more people have been seeing this problem.</p>
