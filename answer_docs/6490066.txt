<p>You did not write what kind of database you have on your web server, but I suppose you have some kind of relational database and then you need some sort of web service in between that you can send data to from your iPhone app in some format, for example XML or JSON. You could for example create a RESTful web service on your server and use <a href="http://restkit.org/" rel="nofollow">RESTKit</a> to communicate with it from your iPhone.</p>
