<p>Thanks! I was just to tired to find this. So this works:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @DivideBy int
SET @DivideBy = 1

IF @DivideBy = 1 BEGIN ;
    SELECT Year(o.AccomplishDate) AS [Rok], Month(o.AccomplishDate) AS [Miesiąc], SUM(oi.Price) AS [Przychód]
    FROM Orders o JOIN OrdersItems oi ON oi.OrderId = o.Id
    WHERE o.State = 0
    GROUP BY Year(o.AccomplishDate), Month(o.AccomplishDate)
    ORDER BY Year(o.AccomplishDate) DESC, Month(o.AccomplishDate) DESC
END ;
IF @DivideBy = 2 BEGIN ;
    SELECT Year(o.AccomplishDate) AS [Rok], SUM(oi.Price) AS [Przychód]
    FROM Orders o JOIN OrdersItems oi ON oi.OrderId = o.Id
    WHERE o.State = 0
    GROUP BY Year(o.AccomplishDate)
    ORDER BY Year(o.AccomplishDate) DESC
END;
</code></pre>

<p>May I optimize this somehow?</p>
