<p>It should be possible to make one script that works with both Entourage and Outlook, without bugging you if one isn't found either when you compile or when you run. I don't have either Entourage or Outlook but it should work like this:</p>

<pre><code>using terms from application "Microsoft Entourage"
    script theScript
        tell application "Finder" to try
            set theApp to application file id "Entourage's Bundle ID" as text
        on error
            set theApp to application file id "Outlook's Bundle ID" as text
        end try
        tell application theApp
            -- do stuff
        end tell
    end script
end using terms from
store script theScript in "MyScript.scpt"
</code></pre>

<p>"using terms from" is only relevant when compiling the script - it isn't needed when running, though for some reason you'll still get bugged if that app isn't found. So by wrapping it around a script object and then writing out that script to file, the resultant script will still run but won't contain "using terms from" and so won't bug the user.</p>

<p>For getting a reference to the right app, Finder can look for it by ID and simply error if it isn't found rather than bugging the user. You'll need to insert the proper ID's there, I don't know what they are.</p>
