<p>No, you will really need to clean it evey frame. But, as pointed out by TJHeuvel, the simple act of clearing the canvas every frame shouldn't affect the performance. The problem is probably in your logic to update the content varibles, possibly looping through objects that don't take any action in the time you update the canvas drawing.</p>
