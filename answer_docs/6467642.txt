<p>I just implemented such a system and found that implementing paypal with custom code is lot better than using any other gem or plugin for this.</p>

<p>If you follow railscasts here - <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search=paypal" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/episodes?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;search=paypal</a>
it does exactly the same thing and is very straight forward. Go through paypal basics, paypal notification and paypal security episodes.</p>
