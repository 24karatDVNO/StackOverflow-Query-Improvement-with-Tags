<p>If your only trying to find out if the string begins with a number.
Like above, you canskip using regex.
Just use Substring, remove the first character and test if it is a number.</p>

<p>Now if your trying to remove the entire number, then I would convert the string to a char array, and test the chars.</p>

<p>pseudo
string s = ""
for each c in chars{
if c is number then
  s += c
else
  exit for
}
convert the s to an integer, you got the number at the begining of the string.</p>
