<p>consider this, how many different combinations can you get? out of 4 (i think its about 16 )</p>

<p>actg = 1
atcg = 2
atgc = 3 and so on, so that </p>

<p>you can create an array like [1,2,3] then you can go one step further, </p>

<p>check if 1 is follow by 2, convert 12 to a, 13 = b and so on... 
if I understand DNA a bit it means that you cannot get a certain value </p>

<p>as a must be match with c, and t with g or something like that which reduces your options,
so basically you can look for a sequence and give it a something you can also convert back...</p>
