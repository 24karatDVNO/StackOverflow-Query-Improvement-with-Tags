<p>I do not think it is possible to set a default namespace on website projects but it is simple to add it yourself after the new file has been created as per:</p>

<pre><code>using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Web;

namespace MySite
{

    /// &lt;summary&gt;
    /// Summary description for Class1
    /// &lt;/summary&gt;
    public class Class1
    {
        public Class1()
        {
            //
            // TODO: Add constructor logic here
            //
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I don't fully understand your second question however if I'm understanding you correctly the order that you create an instance of a class or a variable doesn't matter. Create them as you need them. Variables / objects created in the pageload event will only be available in that event. If you need public variable declare it at the class level.</p>
