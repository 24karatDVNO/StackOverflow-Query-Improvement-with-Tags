<p>Another thought is to use URL Routing if you are using ASP.Net 3.5 or 4.0.  Here is a link - <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/051309-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/articles/051309-1.aspx</a>  The page is specific to 3.5 SP 1, but there is another link on the page for 4.0.  So you might use  http:\\\login and it will route to http:\\\webforms\login.aspx.  HTH  </p>
