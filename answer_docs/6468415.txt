<p>You probably want to use recursion and some kind of index.</p>

<p>Create a function that remove the focus from the previous image (or perhaps just all the images if that will work) and then puts the cornerimgClass on the one that matches an index supplied to the function. Then once this is done it uses setTimeout to call itself agin in 8 seconds with the index incremented by one.</p>

<p>You'll want to do a check for when you reach the end of the list and either stop, reset to 0 or whatever you fancy.</p>

<p>The key thing though is to use recursion with named functions rather than just anonymous functions.</p>
