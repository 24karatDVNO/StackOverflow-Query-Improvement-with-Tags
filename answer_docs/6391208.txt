<p>Take a look at <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0130424110" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Unix Systems Programming</a> by Robbins.  It's really more about POSIX rather than just UNIX, and covers quite a bit of material with some very nice in-depth examples as well.  The POSIX factor means that it translates quite nicely to Linux as well as some other UNIX variants such as BSD and OSX.  After reading it, you'll definitely get a very good overview of how a POSIX system works, as well as an excellent survey of the major areas you'd use the API in such as threading, sockets, and file I/O.</p>
