<p>you can use a two steps solution (it is more readable)<br>
first enclose your actual (and working) sql statment as a view</p>

<pre><code>create view step1 as 
TRANSFORM ....
SELECT ...
FROM ...
PIVOT ...
</code></pre>

<p>and then create a select like:
(you will need a state table like @Tony Andrews says)</p>

<pre><code>select * -- or whatever
from state 
left join step1 on state.id = step1.state
</code></pre>

<p>and that's all</p>
