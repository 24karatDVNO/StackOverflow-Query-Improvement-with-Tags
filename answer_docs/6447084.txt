<p>well u can do something like this without using these above libraries. When u get the page with your tweets parse the <code>urls</code> for any images("twitpic" or "yfrog") and then use ajax to silently download the images in the background and then when user selects the tweet u show the image. The hard part is parsing the url to figure out the images.
i havent tried this but this should work </p>
