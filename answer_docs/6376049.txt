<p>I doubt that you will be penalized for using href="#" or href="#update" aka blind links.</p>

<p>My understanding of SEO is that a crawler will crawl a resource or it wont.  It then calculates the relativity of the crawled / cached content with the search keywords.</p>

<p>How much searchable content will you really have on pages that are forms?  Would you even want crawlers to index that content?  I would say that you probably dont have much searchable content on forms and you probably dont want crawling those pages anyway.</p>

<p>Regarding how to markup your code so that you can find it with jquery, I beleive that Francois Deschenes has the best answer.</p>

<p>Use css for jquery hooks, use href for what it is... a pointer to a resource.</p>
