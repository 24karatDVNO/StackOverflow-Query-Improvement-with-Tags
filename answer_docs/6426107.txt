<p>I've completed a couple of mobile web assignments recently, and in both instances I did a lot of the up-front development testing in desktop Safari, before checking stuff out on the devices themselves (I also use a Mac, so I can use the iOS emulator, but that's beside the point for you). This worked pretty well to be honest, but if I was doing extensive debugging on the device itself, I'd look at Weinre too (as linked in the answer above).</p>
