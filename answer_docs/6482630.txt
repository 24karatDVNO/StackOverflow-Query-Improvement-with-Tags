<p><code>ajaxSetup</code> makes the settings the default for all futher calls to <code>ajax</code>. You won't have to repeat that setting every time you do an AJAX call.</p>

<p>This is documented in <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/" rel="nofollow"><code>$.ajaxSetup</code></a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All subsequent Ajax calls using any function will use the new settings</p>
