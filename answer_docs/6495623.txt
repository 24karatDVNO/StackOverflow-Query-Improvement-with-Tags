<p>Unfortunately, you had to set up the log of raw queries before. There are plenty of solutions for this on internet (via trace of profiler or others). All the logs are written permanently into LOG file of DBMS, but just for transactional IO purposes, once they are rolled to hard drive, the queries themselves leave the log. SQL Agent Error log might have some data you might want to check out. It is in object explorer -> SQL Server Agent -> Error logs</p>
