<p>The service feature of JXTA is unfortunately poorly designed and ought to be re-written from scratch. As I mentioned in other posts on the net, people should avoid using JXTA to load services. Use OSGi instead (for example).</p>

<p>The service feature of JXTA has not been fully tested (mostly because of a lack of resources and interest from the community). We focused on other key issues first. It is possible that loading services on customized peergroups may contain a bug indeed.</p>
