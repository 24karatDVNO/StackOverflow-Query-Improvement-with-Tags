<p>Not only should you be saving user data in the documents directory.</p>

<pre><code>/**
 Returns the path to the application's Documents directory.
 */
- (NSString *)applicationDocumentsDirectory {
    return [NSSearchPathForDirectoriesInDomains(NSDocumentDirectory, NSUserDomainMask, YES) lastObject];
}
</code></pre>

<p>But you should also only store relative paths to the files located in that directory.  If you store the absolute path, your app won't find the data after an update.  </p>
