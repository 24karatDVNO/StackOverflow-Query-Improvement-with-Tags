<p>You're asking if this solution is "reasonable". Since you obviously don't mean "secure", it's unclear what you <em>do</em> mean. I'm going to guess you mean "possible and easy to implement", in which case the answer is <strong>yes</strong>. But feel free to edit your question to make it more clear.</p>
