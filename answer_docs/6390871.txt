<p>If you need a UILabel that can display some Rich-Text, like a text with the first part in blue and the other in red, you can use my <a href="https://github.com/AliSoftware/OHAttributedLabel/" rel="nofollow">OHAttributedLabel</a> class, which is a subclass of UILabel that uses CoreText to draw NSAttributedStrings. (iOS 3.2+)</p>

<p>It is very simple to use and also provide a category for NSAttribtedString that adds some useful methods, like easily change the style of a range of text without the need to know the CoreText attributes constants.</p>

<p>[EDIT] Sorry I didn't realized that Thomas Wanner already mentioned my class in his answer</p>
