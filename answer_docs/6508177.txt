<p>According to the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html" rel="nofollow">python re documentation</a>, \d matches any digit if the UNICODE flag is not set. If the flag is set, then it matches anything considered a digit in that locale. </p>

<p>It won't match negative numbers without some additions though:</p>

<pre><code>-?\d+
</code></pre>

<p>This works, but does not get any number, since numbers are quite complex little things. 
Try this one:</p>

<pre><code>[-+]?\d*\.?\d+([eE][-+]?\d+)?
</code></pre>
