<p>There are different levels of security that the device manufacturer can specify when building the OS. At the highest level, you need to have your application signed. At the lowest level, you can copy an executable to the device and run it. There are intermediate levels that will allow applications installed via CAB file to run even if they are not signed. In general, if the device is purchased from a cell phone carrier, you will probably need to sign the app (or hack the device). If the device is purchased from the manufacturer and you add your own SIM card, there is a good chance it won't need signing. In my experience, more WM6 devices have the higher security settings than WM5 devices.</p>
