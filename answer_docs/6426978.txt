<p>Interesting question but the direct answer is no, that is not possible.  However, you can use a view or a stored procedure that will allow you to write out the 19 columns once and then just call the stored procedure or view using a <code>SELECT * FROM view</code> or <code>exec storedproc</code></p>

<p>The only issue here is that if you add/remove/renamed a column to your table, you will need to update your object (view or stored procedure) to reflect the new/removed/renamed column.</p>
