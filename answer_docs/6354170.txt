<p>I'm using this method:</p>

<p>1- Create a bounding box with path element (not rect) of the path you want to fill.
2- Append "z" and the path string of the path you want to fill to the bounding box path string. This will create a clipped rect.
3- Use javascript for repeating pattern behind the clipped rect.</p>
