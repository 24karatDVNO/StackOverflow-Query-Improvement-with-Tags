<p>Just as a thought... try restarting your iPhone.  If you have a lot of pages open in Safari, it won't cache them for as long and will force a refresh when you open it again.  For example, if you open a page, leave it open for a long time (days maybe) and then come back, it'll definately refresh itself as Safari will have cleared the cache allocated to that particular page.  Cache times also change by device (pages refresh more often on an iPhone 3G than an iPhone 4) due to the amount of memory, processor etc.</p>
