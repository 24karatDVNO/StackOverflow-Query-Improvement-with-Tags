<p>Yes the deceleration is valid. Think about it this way, a hex literal is no different then a decimal literal. If they wanted the result of the hex converted to decimal to be zero, then this might not be the case (depends on which system is in use and which negative-number system is in use: 1's complement, 2's complement or a simple Not operator)</p>
