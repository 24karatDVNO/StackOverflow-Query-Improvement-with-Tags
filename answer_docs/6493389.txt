<blockquote>
  <p>take the "tid" and find the corresponding entry that has an action of "New Ticket Response made by XXX" where XXX is anything except for "User"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Simples:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT b1.tid AS Tid, MIN(DATEDIFF(b2.date,b1.date)) AS ResponseTime
FROM billing b1 INNER join billing b2 
  ON b1.tid = b2.tid
WHERE b1.action='New Support Ticket Opened'
AND b2.action LIKE 'New Ticket Response made by%'
AND b2.action &lt;&gt; 'New Ticket Response made by User'
GROUP BY Tid
</code></pre>

<p>And if you want to find the actual user.....</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SUBSTR(b2.action, LENGTH('New Ticket Response made by ')) AS user,
  b1.tid AS Tid, MIN(DATEDIFF(b2.date,b1.date)) AS ResponseTime
....
</code></pre>

<p>(since LENGTH('New Ticket Response made by ') is constant, you'll get better performance replacing it with a literal integer)</p>
