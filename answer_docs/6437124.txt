<p>I have just looked at their website and I can not see where they are advertising it as a proxy service that can be used in this manner.  Your code does look correct and should work against a proper proxy service.  I think the problem is that this web based "Webpage Requesting" service is not a proper proxy server.</p>

<p>Hope that this helps</p>
