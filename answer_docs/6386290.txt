<p>The above snippets use the iis:WebAddress in an improper way. You need to add IP="*" if you want this to work with all websites that match the name and the port. The above example fails during the install if there is an ip address assigned to the website in IIS (wix CA will not find it in general)</p>

<p>Rant: wix is terrible for many reasons, in my opinion and this is a good example. If the attribute is missing it will only work for websites with the default IP - how unintuitive is this. Wix should at least emit a waring for a missing IP element. Furthermore the default IP (localhost) is represented as * in IIS metabase, at the same time in the wix file * means all websites (not only *). So it is really confusing and not intuitive at all.</p>
