<p>I'm fairly sure this isn't possible I'm afraid - if you lay anything over the map (even if it is transparent) it will prevent you interacting with the map - as you will be clicking on that div, rather than on the map. Also IE seems to have some problems with masking google maps.</p>

<p>You could have an overlay that dissappears when you hover over it, using jquery or the :hover clss to move it to a negative z-index, but I really don't don't think you can do what you need to do.</p>

<p>(ps - I tried to comment on the answer above - but for some reason I couldn't - sorry for the new answer)</p>
