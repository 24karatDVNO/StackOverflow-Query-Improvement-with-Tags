<p>I'm not aware of a callback for what you're looking for.   I would read up on Ruby Delegators for a possible solution that's more elegant than what I've sketched below.</p>

<p>You can wrap the object and intercept on method_missing.</p>

<pre><code>class A
  def foo
    puts "hi there, I'm A"
  end 
end 

maybe have B inherit A? 
class B 
  def initialize 
    @a = A.new
  end 

  def method_missing(m, *args, &amp;block)
    puts "hi there, I'm in B"
    @a.send(m, *args, &amp;block) if @a.respond_to? m
    puts "all done"
  end 
end 
</code></pre>
