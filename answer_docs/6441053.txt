<p>If you are used to using Visual Studio on windows or other big IDEs, I'd recommend you use Eclipse for Java Developers.</p>

<p>If you are just getting started, I'd suggest you skip out on IDEs.  For me, Eclipse was more trouble than I needed.  Using VIM or Notepad++ and a batch file gives you great results.</p>
