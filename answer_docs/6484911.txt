<p>The right way to do this is to populate the model from within the controller and send it to the view.</p>

<pre><code>// create a new model object
MyViewModel model = new MyViewModel();

// populate the "Field" property in said object
model.Field = "this is my field text";

// send the pre-populated model to the veiw
return View(model);
</code></pre>
