<p>Eventually I cheated. In prototype on view.phtml I hid my product options block during page load, then on DOM loaded I appendchilded it to the description div in the tabs then unhid it. This works well as the page top - above the fold - loads cleanly and the options drop in later without the visitor being aware that something has gone on.</p>
