<p>If you want to get just two IDs with profilename and photo thumb, first you should remove a.id from your query and use JOIN</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT a.venue_id,a.user_id,mm.profilenam,mm1.photo_thumb
FROM announce_arrival a
LEFT JOIN members mm ON a.user_id = mm.mem_id
LEFT JOIN members mm1 ON a.venue_id = mm1.mem_id
</code></pre>

<p>But it seems for me, than you have strange DB scheme and strange references.</p>
