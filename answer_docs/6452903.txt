<p>This doesn't address all of the issues that you might need to consider, but here is a different way to think about your script:</p>

<pre><code>my @regexes = (
    qr/(...)/,
    qr/(...)/,
);

for my $r (@regexes){
    my $letter = 'a';
    my @matches = map { $_ =~ $r ? $1 : () } @results;
    print join(' ', $_, $letter ++), "\n" for @matches;
}
</code></pre>
