<p>Your code works (gives output) if you are using a main method that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    Restaurant r = new Restaurant();
    new Thread(r).start();
    new Thread(r).start();
    new Thread(r).start();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The program will run for a while, and will then halt since it will wait for more "requests", it's not stuck in a deadlock. A deadlock requires two different locks, and you only got one in your code.</p>

<p>Note that you still might have logical "flaws/bugs"</p>
