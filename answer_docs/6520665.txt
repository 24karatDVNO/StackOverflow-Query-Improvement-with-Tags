<p>OK, <a href="http://pastebin.com/yjFMKpEW" rel="nofollow">your layout file</a> is unnecessarily large and complex. So let's try a couple of things- </p>

<p>First, try creating a simple version of your XML file that contains the barebones for displaying the image. If that works in both portrait and landscape, you know that the problem is not your activity or your image. </p>

<p>If the first step works, the next step would be to work on simplifying your layout file, there is a lot that could be pruned. It goes seven layers deep at points, that should almost never happen. <a href="http://www.curious-creature.org/2009/02/22/android-layout-tricks-1/" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is a good blog post by an Android engineer on better layout design.
