<p>Here is <em>my solution</em>. Hope it helps:</p>

<pre><code>    Dim fileAContent As String = ""

    Using strR As New IO.StreamReader(fileAPath)
        fileAContent = strR.ReadToEnd
    End Using

    Using strW As New IO.StreamWriter(fileBPath, True)
        strW.Write(fileAContent)
        strW.Flush()
    End Using
</code></pre>

<p>Second parameter of <strong>StreamWriter</strong> is the key. It will <strong>append</strong> content to the end of file.</p>

<p>First read all lines from the first file and after that append all of them to second file.</p>
