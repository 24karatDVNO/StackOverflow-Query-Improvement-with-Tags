<p>I'm not sure of the version of BE.NET you're using, but I'd probably recommend using the main RSS feed.</p>

<p>This would allow you to programmatically display your articles either via server- or client-side code.</p>

<p>If you want to tell us more about your environment I can point you towards some resources for one of the above, if needed.</p>

<p>(Off the cuff, if I were implementing I'd use jQuery for the client-side and LINQ to XML server-side.)</p>
