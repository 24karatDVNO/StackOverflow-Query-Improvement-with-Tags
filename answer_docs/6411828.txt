<p>I don't believe there's any way for rails to know about apache aliases other than by reading an apache config file and interpreting it yourself.</p>

<p>Remember, rails can be run through other web servers too.</p>

<p>Why can't you just have ckfinder installed in the "public" directory of your rails app so it can always be found relative to the app?</p>
