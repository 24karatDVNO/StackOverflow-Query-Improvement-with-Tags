<p>ISPP is a Pre-Processor, so this means this code run's prior to compiling the SETUP.EXE</p>

<p>The AppName is used for a variety of purposes but one is the SETUP.EXE Resource.    Which is why it can't be set at runtime using <code>{code: }</code></p>

<p>So you could a compile time and have a different SETUP.EXE for each language.</p>

<p>You can do this in a  number of ways, using the ISPP, here is one.   </p>

<pre><code>#define lang = "english"
[Setup]
#if lang == "english"
AppName=The Ball
#elif lang == "spanish"
AppName=La Bola
#else
# error Unsupported Language
#endif

AppVersion=1.5
;AppVerName=My Program 1.5
DefaultDirName={pf}\My Program

[Languages]
#if lang == "english"
Name: "en"; MessagesFile: "compiler:Default.isl"
#elif lang == "spanish"
Name: "spanish"; MessagesFile: "compiler:Languages\Spanish.isl"
#else
# error Unsupported Language
#endif
