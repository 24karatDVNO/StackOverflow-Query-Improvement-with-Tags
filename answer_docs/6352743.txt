<p>I don't know SqlLite, but I hope this will work anyway. It doesn't use anything fancy.</p>

<pre><code>Select t1.* 
From Table1 t1
Left join Table1 t2
On t1.FullName = t2.FullName
And t1.DateInsertedToDatabase = t2.DateInsertedToDatabase + 1
Where t1.DateInsertedToDatabase = (select max(DateInsertedToDatabase) from Table1)
And (t1.DateModified &lt;&gt; t2.DateModified or t2.FullName is null)
</code></pre>

<p>Joining on DateInsertedToDatabase + 1 will join with the previous record. Then you filter for the highest DateInsertedToDatabase and include either records that don't have a match (they are new) or where the modified dates don't match. </p>
