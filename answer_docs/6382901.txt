<p>I do like the divide-and-conquer comments here, but I have to admit: If you're running into trouble with 2.5mio words, something's going wrong with your original approach. Even if we assume each word is unique within those 2.5mio (which basically rules out that what we're talking about is a text in a natural language) and assuming each word is on average 100 unicode characters long we're at 500MB for storing the unique strings plus some overhead for storing the set structure. Meaning: You should be doing really fine since those numbers are totally overestimated already. Maybe before installing Hadoop, you could try increasing your heap size?</p>
