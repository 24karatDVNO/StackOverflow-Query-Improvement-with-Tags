<p>You can cancel an AsyncTask by calling <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html#cancel%28boolean%29" rel="nofollow">AsyncTask.cancel(..)</a> and then start up a new AsyncTask.  You are not supposed to run the AsyncTask as a parallel activity - it is supposed to be able to run and finish without outside intervention.</p>
