<p>How long does it take from the beginning of the operation to the point when the Oracle error occurs? In situations that I've seen it the time could be measured in hours and it was a good indication that the work should have been cut up in chunks with commits after every chunk. If that time is short, you might be just running out of the disk space or have your Oracle instance misconfigured.</p>
