<p>Mail goes out on the account that the user selects -- it's an option in the messaging UI that appears.</p>

<p>And the messaging rate is limited by how often your user is prepared to press the "Send" button. I don't think iOS has a limit, but if you're sending messages to a lot of people some mail servers will throttle the rate of sending. But this shouldn't affect your app as iOS sends messages in the background.</p>
