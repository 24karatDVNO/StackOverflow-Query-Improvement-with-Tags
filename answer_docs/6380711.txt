<p>"Keys" might refer to one of:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/column-indexes.html" rel="nofollow">Index</a> (search optimization)</li>
<li>Constraint (e.g. <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/innodb-foreign-key-constraints.html" rel="nofollow">foreign key</a>, <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/constraint-primary-key.html" rel="nofollow">primary key</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>You may want multiple because you need to implement more than one of these features in a single table.  It's actually quite common.</p>
