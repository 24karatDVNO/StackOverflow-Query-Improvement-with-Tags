<p>You could use an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/AsyncTask.html" rel="nofollow">AsyncTask</a> within which you would call <code>Thread.sleep(Random.nextInt(2)+3)</code> in the <code>doInBackground()</code> method.  Within the AsyncTask class, you can show and hide the progress bar with the <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/painless-threading.html" rel="nofollow">onPreExecute() and onPostExecute()</a> methods.</p>
