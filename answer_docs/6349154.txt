<p>The second sample is passing a reference to the function itself instead of the result. If you want to invoke it inline, you can do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>  previousWinner((function (response) {
        alert(response);
        //Check to see if user is a winner
        if (!response) {
            //Check likes
            hasUserLiked();
        }
    })());
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: And in cases "webmethods", by which I assume you mean AJAX calls, you are passing a reference to the function to be used as a callback when the request returns. That's what makes it asynchronous (the A in AJAX).</p>
