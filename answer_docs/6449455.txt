<p>I suggest that you should not be adding optional label in SelectList or as SelectListItem. you have overloads for <code>Html.DropDown</code> and <code>Html.DropDownListFor</code> that would allow you to insert an optional label at the top of your dropdown list. Pleas check my answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6449033/insert-initial-blank-row-into-select-list-mvc-linq-sql/6449348#6449348">this question</a>.</p>
