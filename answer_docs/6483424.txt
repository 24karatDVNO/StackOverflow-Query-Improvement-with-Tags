<p>Why are stack- and heap- based objects excluded???</p>

<p>They are &quot;excluded&quot; because they <strong>do not</strong> exist from the time it is constructed and created until the end of the program.</p>
<p>None of this contradicts what you wrote / understand in your 2nd paragraph, though there may be nuances depending on the programming language that you are talking about.</p>
<hr />
<p>What you've found is a poorly worded definition of <code>static</code>.  Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
