<p>You need some software that will execute your pyton code..</p>

<p>You can try a 100% python stack with <a href="http://www.tornadoweb.org/" rel="nofollow">tornado</a></p>

<p>Or you can use Apache, Nginx or Lighttpd (i think all written in C) and then use some mod (mod_wsgi, fgci or uWsgi) in order to make this webservers run your code using <a href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0333/" rel="nofollow">wsgi</a> interface. This second option is like what apache+some_mod do to run your PHP code..</p>

<p>I have production sites running on Apache+mod_wsgi and Nginx+uWsgi</p>
