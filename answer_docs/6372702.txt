<p>The solution turns out to be what I proposed in Edit2. I'm not sure why, but doing the pop-up from inside the ScrolledArea DoubleClick event was causing problems. The solution is to create a custom message and send it to self inside the double-click event. The custom event is handled by the top level window, not the scrolled area. This works fine, but now I have to store the ID of the selected object somewhere so the top level window can pass it to the dialog. This is slightly more work, but it feels more "correct" than popping up a window inside the double-click event of the drawing area. However, the window is still being popped up inside an event handler, it's just a different object handling it with a different event. The specifics of why this works still elude me. </p>

<p>I'm sure there is a way of thinking about this that makes this solution obviously correct. I'll still up-vote an answer that offers insight into why one method works and not the other, or what the "correct" way to do this type of thing is.</p>

<p>In other news, I'm posting this after a +50 bounty expired on this question. Yeah, I posted a bounty before trying my own idea - silly me. Next time I will try the wxPython mailing list before offering a bounty, although I don't like mailing lists.</p>
