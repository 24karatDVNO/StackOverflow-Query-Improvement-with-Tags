<p>You can pass HTML attributes to the widget via the <code>attrs</code> parameter. Also, take a look at <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter07/" rel="nofollow">chapter 7</a> of the <a href="http://djangobook.com" rel="nofollow">Django book</a>, especially the section <em>Customizing Form Design</em>.</p>

<p>Section teaser:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While it’s convenient to have our form’s HTML generated for us, in many cases you’ll want to override the default rendering. <code>{{ form.as_table }}</code> and friends are useful shortcuts while you develop your application, but everything about the way a form is displayed can be overridden, mostly within the template itself, and you’ll probably find yourself doing this.</p>
