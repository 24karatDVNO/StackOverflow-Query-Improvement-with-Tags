<p>Ah, this works:</p>

<pre><code>Factory.define :task do |t|
  t.association :user
  t.after_create {|t| t.user.tasks &lt;&lt; t}
end
</code></pre>

<p>John, your approach would work but I actually couldn't use what you described because in my test the tasks need to also reference another (unmentioned) model and I don't see a way of referencing it in the <code>user_with_tasks</code> factory definition.</p>
