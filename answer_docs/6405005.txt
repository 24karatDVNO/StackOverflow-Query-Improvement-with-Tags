<p>Assuming that you're on a *nix platform and that you have the process ID (i.e. you spawned the process yourself used some other method to infer its <code>pid</code>), using <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/2/kill" rel="nofollow"><code>kill(2)</code></a> should work:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;sys/types.h&gt;
#include &lt;signal.h&gt;

void main() {
    /* ... */
    pid_t pid = ???;
    kill(pid, SIGTERM);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will only work under certain conditions, though:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For a process to have permission to send a signal it must either be privileged (under Linux: have the CAP_KILL capability), or the real or effective user ID of the sending process must equal the real or saved set-user-ID of the target process. In the case of SIGCONT it suffices when the sending and receiving processes belong to the same session.</p>
