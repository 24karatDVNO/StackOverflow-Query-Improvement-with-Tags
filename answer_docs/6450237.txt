<pre><code>var bw = new BackgroundWorker();
bw.DoWork += (s, e) =&gt; e.Result = getAllBoxers();
bw.RunWorkerCompleted += (s, e) =&gt;
    {
        var boxers = e.Result as List&lt;Boxer&gt;;
        dgvBoxers.DataSource = boxers;
    };
bw.RunWorkerAsync();
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure to never do anything that affects the GUI in the <code>DoWork</code> because WinForms isn't thread safe.</p>
