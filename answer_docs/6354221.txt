<p>I found another interesting module that's straightforward to use and I'll use it! The module is readline and you just need to import it to have a bash shell (handle keyboard, history-list, etc) "simulation". It's for *nix systems. I'm at beginning with python language and I don't know all modules yet. <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/readline.html" rel="nofollow">readline</a></p>
