<p>If you think to parse code and search isolated int word, this works:</p>

<pre><code>(^int|[\(\ \;,]int)
</code></pre>

<p>You can use it to find int that in code can be only preceded by space, comma, ";" and left parenthesis or be the first word of line.</p>

<p>You can try it here and enhance it <a href="http://www.regextester.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.regextester.com/</a></p>

<p>PS: this works in all your test cases.</p>
