<p>You can't have a union or query on a non-existent object at compile time (compiling to a query plan just before execution).</p>

<p>So there is no way to refer to a non-existent table in the same batch</p>

<p>The pattern you have to use is like this: dynamic SQL is a separate batch</p>

<pre><code>IF OBJECT('tempdb..#temp1') IS NOT NULL
  EXEC ('SELECT * FROM #temp1')
ELSE IF OBJECT('tempdb..#temp3') IS NOT NULL
  EXEC ('SELECT * FROM #temp3')
ELSE IF OBJECT('tempdb..#temp3') IS NOT NULL
  EXEC ('SELECT * FROM #temp3')
...
</code></pre>
