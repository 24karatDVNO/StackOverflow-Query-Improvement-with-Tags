<p>If you've breaked right after the method call and it has no side-effects or mutable state that affects the outcome of multiple calls you could call it again in the immediate window? I.e. type "GetFishsticks()" in the immediate window. Just be aware that execution needs to be stopped in the same stack-frame as where you do the call. </p>
