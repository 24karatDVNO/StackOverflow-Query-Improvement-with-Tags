<p>Intersect is a method for finding the intersection of one or more ranges: it won't work with arrays. It returns the subset range that is the intersection of the range arguments.<br/>
Unless your arrays are sorted it would probably be more efficient to just loop compare the arrays than use .MATCH</p>
