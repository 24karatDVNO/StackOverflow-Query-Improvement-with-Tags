<p>Yes this problem is very very common. I similarly have this issue, even to this day. I've tried installation on Windows XP, Vista, and 7, all have failed.</p>

<p>The only way I'm able to work on Pligg is installing directly onto my hosting server. There I don't get any problems, go through the install process and access my site. Check out <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=pligg+localhost+problem" rel="nofollow">this quick google search</a> as many of the top links from forums.pligg.com may offer a solution. </p>

<p>Unfortunately though, I haven't found one. To this day I still deploy my Pligg launches onto the server in a sandbox before going live.</p>
