<p>I've actually built my own since I don't have the need for a strength meter; just a requirements checker.</p>

<p>By using a simple password.match using a regular expression, I was able to check for these certain words.  The requirements that were given to me didn't specify upper or lower case letters, so I did a simple match.</p>

<pre><code> password.match(/((SYSTEM)|(Password)|(Default)|(USER)|(Demo)|(TEST))/)
</code></pre>

<p>I was also able to check for the below using different algorithms.</p>

<pre><code> //password != user name, first name, or last name
 //password != 6 chars, 6 nums, or 6 symbols
 //password != social security numbers
 //password != a date
 //password = 3 of 4 requirements (upper, lower, num, char)
</code></pre>
