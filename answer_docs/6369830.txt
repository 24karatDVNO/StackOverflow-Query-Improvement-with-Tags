<p>I have managed to get to the client machine again - and added a new simple template to prove or otherwise my issue. The new <code>WorkBook_Open</code> routine is...<br></p>

<pre><code>Private Sub WorkBook_Open()
    MsgBox "Hello World"
    With ThisWorkbook.VBProject.VBComponents("ThisWorkbook").CodeModule
        .DeleteLines 1, _
        .CountOfLines
    End With
    MsgBox "Goodbye to all that!"
End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>...and this works exactly as required i.e. the routine executes then deletes itself (the second msgbox displays even though the code has been deleted!</p>

<p>So, this test invalidates my question - McAfee is NOT deleting the routine as part of AV protection - so I am no longer looking for a workaround! </p>

<p>Now all I need to do is to figure out what my problem really is!</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments</p>
