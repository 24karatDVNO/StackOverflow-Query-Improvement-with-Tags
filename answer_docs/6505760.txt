<p>This is a common problem in learning css.
I reccomend using this example as your guideline: <a href="http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/" rel="nofollow">http://www.htmldog.com/articles/suckerfish/dropdowns/</a></p>

<p>The background for #background isn't appearing because it contains only floated elements.
You can fix this bey giving it a set height in css, or by using the "clearfix" method ( <a href="http://perishablepress.com/press/2009/12/06/new-clearfix-hack/" rel="nofollow">http://perishablepress.com/press/2009/12/06/new-clearfix-hack/</a> )</p>
