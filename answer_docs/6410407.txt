<p>Assuming you have lists implemented as nested lists, you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt; lists = new List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt;();

// fill data here
// ...
// ...

List&lt;List&lt;int&gt;&gt; filtered = lists.Where(lst =&gt; lst.Any(num =&gt; num != 0)).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>If what you need is an object that contains only properties that satisfy a condition, a reflection (or perhaps Dynamic object from .NET 4.0) should be used. And in that case I wouldn't force doing it with lambdas.</p>

<p>Try to explain your data structure in more details so someone can give a useful answer.</p>
