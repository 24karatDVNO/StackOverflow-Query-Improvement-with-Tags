<p>Just a guess: Does Google's APIs require to send a valid referer ? Because I think it's not possible with the current version of the SDK to change the referer (but it will be with the Mango - 7.1 release as the beta only remove the bad referer i.e. the guid ID of the app when using the Image control for example).</p>
