<p>You could also try to use maven and as long as your tests are annotated correctly and in /src/test/java they will all be run for you with <code>mvn integration-test</code> (as long as you have the proper dependencies defined and I believe maven-surefire-plugin). This might be more difficult to setup initially but usually pays off.</p>
