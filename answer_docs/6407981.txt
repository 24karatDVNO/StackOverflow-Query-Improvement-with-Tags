<p><code>next = 0</code> marks the end of the list, similar to a zero-terminated string. It is a convention with linked lists in general. As you populate the list, you move the zero-terminated <code>next</code> pointer forward (across the list). All other nodes have a valid <code>next</code> value pointing to the next node in the list.</p>
