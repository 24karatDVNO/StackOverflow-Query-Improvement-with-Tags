<p>All variables / fields in java that are derived from java.lang.Object are "references" and that is basically exactly the same as a pointer in C++. (Not to be mixed up with C++ references which are <em>also</em> only pointers but with a special semantic)
That means int, float and all other primnitives are values and not pointers/references, ofc.</p>
