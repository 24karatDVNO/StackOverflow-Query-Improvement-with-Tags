<p><strong>A good start: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/morrison/jgay7/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/morrison/jgay7/</a></strong></p>

<p>I didn't want to take all the work on myself, but that extension I wrote will get the values of the second validate parameter, in this case it would select [1,255] from length.  It returns an array of arrays, where the inner array holds the values previously mentioned.  This should be a good base for you to parse out what you want.  </p>

<p>Comment if you need more direction.</p>
