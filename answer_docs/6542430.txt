<p>You will need to create a <code>robots.txt</code> file containing the following:</p>

<pre><code>User-agent: *
Disallow: /
</code></pre>

<p>and place it in <code>usr/local/psa/admin/htdocs</code>. Note that the location might vary depending on your installation.</p>

<p>Afterwards, verify that the file served at <code>http://my.domain.com:8443/robots.txt</code> points to this file and has the same contents. Also make sure that <code>http://my.domain.com/robots.txt</code> (the port serving your public site [usually the implied port 80]) <em>does not</em> point to the same file. If it does then you site won't be indexed at all.</p>

<p>This file will tell Google and other bots to not index the Plesk pages such as the login page.

Additionally you may want to add your domain to the <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/" rel="nofollow">Google Webmaster Tools</a> and check that the Plesk pages have indeed been removed by checking the <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals" rel="nofollow">removals page</a>.</p>
