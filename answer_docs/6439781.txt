<p>I've had the same problem and here is my solution. Just add this to your AdDelegate:</p>

<pre><code>- (BOOL)bannerViewActionShouldBegin:(ADBannerView *)banner willLeaveApplication:(BOOL)willLeave
{
    if (!willLeave)
        [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:YES animated:YES];
    return YES;
}

- (void)bannerViewActionDidFinish:(ADBannerView *)banner
{
    [[UIApplication sharedApplication] setStatusBarHidden:NO animated:YES];
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's very simple; when the ad appears I hide the status bar and when the ad disappears I  show it again. I hope the answer helps some people.</p>
