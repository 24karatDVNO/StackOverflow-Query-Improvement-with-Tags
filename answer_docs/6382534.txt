<p>An alternative - if we are only talking very little data, e.g. a pointer to the last read item - you can use the view state. See <code>IViewPart.init(IViewSite site, IMemento memento)</code> and <code>IViewPart.saveState(IMemento memento)</code>. This method is not very useful if you have lots of data as the storage is rather ineffective.</p>
