<p>There isn't a way to specifically set the Loader to size your loaded swf upon completion of a load.</p>

<p>If you always want your loaded swf to be 100% of the stage's width and height, you WOULD need to do a stage resize listener and resize it inside the event handler. If you want it to initialize at 100%, you could do the following inside the <strong>loaded swf</strong>:</p>

<pre><code>import flash.events.Event

addEventListener (Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, onAddedToStage);

function onAddedToStage (e:Event):void{
    removeEventListener (Event.ADDED_TO_STAGE, onAddedToStage)
    this.width = stage.stageWidth;
    this.height = stage.stageHeight;
}
</code></pre>
