<p>Dont have VS right now to test compiling the code, but this should convey the logic.
You can build up the array list with as many of the types without having to repeat the test logic with big if-else or switch statements. </p>

<pre><code>    TheType[] typesWithPanel = new TheType[] { TheType.Train, TheType.Car, TheType.Hotel};
    if (typesWithPanel.Contains(model.ModelType) &amp;&amp; panelCount &lt; NumberOfPanelsToShow)
    {
        panelTypeList.Add(model.ModelType);
        panelCount++;
    }
</code></pre>
