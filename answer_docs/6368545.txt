<p>This looks like a hack, but it worked and is pretty accurate:</p>

<pre><code>
private Point _releasePoint;

public Grid()
{
   Grid.MouseLeftButtonUp += new MouseButtonEventHandler(Grid_MouseLeftButtonUp);
}

void Grid_MouseLeftButtonUp(object sender, MouseButtonEventArgs e)
{
   _releasePoint = e.GetPosition(Grid);
}

private void DragAndDrop_ItemDroppedOnTarget(object sender, ItemDragEventArgs e)
{
   // fires next and _releasePoint is already set
}
</code></pre>
