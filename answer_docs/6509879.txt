<p>You can use an algorithm like this:</p>

<ol>
<li>When the "start" event occurs, store the start time in a database.</li>
<li>Periodically send AJAX requests to a backend script. If the time has expired, return a response that ends the test.</li>
</ol>

<p>There is not a real "timer" in this case -- just a start time, and logic to check if 15 minutes have passed since that time. If you want to display a timer to the user, the math will be straightforward.</p>
