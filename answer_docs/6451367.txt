<p>Personally, I'd structure the array slightly different.  Instead of having numeric keys, i'd set the key as the email address.  This way you can simply use <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-unique.php" rel="nofollow">array_unique</a>.  </p>

<p>If you <strong>can't</strong> change the array as you get it now, you can loop through it and extract each email address out and insert it into a new array:</p>

<pre><code>$uniqueEmails = array();
foreach ($yourArray as $k =&gt; $v) { 
  if (isset($v['Email']) $uniqueEmails[$v['Email']] = $v['Email'];
}
return $uniqueEmails;
</code></pre>
