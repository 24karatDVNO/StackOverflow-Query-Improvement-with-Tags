<p>The only way to know for sure if the current trunk matches a given tag is to run something like <code>svn diff --summarize ^/trunk/ ^/tags/foobar</code>. This is because tags in subersion are nothing more than a naming convention for directories. Any existing tag could represent a combination of multiple revisions, copied from anywhere in the repository.</p>
