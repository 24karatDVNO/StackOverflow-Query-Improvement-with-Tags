<p>InnerText is one of those browser finicky ones that are named differently in different browsers.  If you are just getting started with javascript I would recommend using a framework like <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">jQuery</a> because it's far simpler to call a function like:  </p>

<pre><code>$('#linkID').text('show');   
</code></pre>

<p>Than it is to get each browser variant set properly.  The framework does all that for you.</p>
