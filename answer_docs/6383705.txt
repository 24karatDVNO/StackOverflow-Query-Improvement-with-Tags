<p>When you have constructors or methods like the above, the compiler generally tries to find the closest match possible and uses that.</p>

<p>The way to think of <code>null</code> in these circumstances is it acts as a subtype of all types (yes, it's not strictly speaking true but it provides a good platform for thinking about what happens). So using this rule it fits string more closely than object, hence this is the constructor that is executed.</p>
