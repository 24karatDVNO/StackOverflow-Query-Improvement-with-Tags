<p>My view: Using Integer as parameters or return values allows one thing that primitive ints don't allow: Using <code>null</code>. But is this a good idea? I think it rarely ever is.</p>

<p>As far as performance is concerned: The compiler will optimize your code to some degree, so that is most of the time not a real concern.</p>
