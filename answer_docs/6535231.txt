<p>This is a common error that can be fixed using 'getApplicationContext' instead of 'this' in your dialog. See also <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6493843/fatal-exception-main/6493937#6493937">FATAL EXCEPTION: main</a>. The error occurs when you (from the dialog) attempt to use the context of the activity that started the dialog, when that activity is no longer in the foreground.</p>
