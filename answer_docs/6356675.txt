<p>You could get the string and split it into an array using spaces as delimiters.</p>

<p>Then you iterate over these words and check if it's longer than the first field <em>free</em> space: </p>

<ul>
<li>if it's longer you check if it's an URL: if so, you put directly to the second field, otherwise you split it.</li>
<li>if it's not longer you append the word to the first field</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you put a (part) of a word to the second field, the remaining words go directly to the second field.</p>
