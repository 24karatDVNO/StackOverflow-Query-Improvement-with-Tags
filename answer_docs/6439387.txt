<p>You can use firebug addon of firefox browser to see content of HTTP request/response.
It does't require any server (but of course, if you dont have server which process requests from browser and send responses to browser, you 'll always see response "unable to connect").</p>

<p>If you still need to mock response, you can create simple server which is able to respond with mock responses, for example java servlet at tomcat server, with code like this:</p>

<pre>
public class MyMockServlet extends HttpServlet {
..
private String mockHeaders = "...";
private String mockResponse = "my response";
 public void service(HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response){
    setHeaderAndBodyInResponse(response);//your method
 }
}
</pre>
