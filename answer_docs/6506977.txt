<p>With mac ports mpfr, libmpc and gmp installed, I was able to tack this on the configure script:</p>

<pre><code>--with-mpc=/opt/local/var/macports/software/libmpc/0.8.2_0/opt/local
--with-gmp=/opt/local/var/macports/software/gmp/5.0.1_0/opt/local
--with-mpfr=/opt/local/var/macports/software/mpfr/3.0.0-p8_0/opt/local 
</code></pre>

<p>This was to compile a ti msp430 toolchain.</p>
