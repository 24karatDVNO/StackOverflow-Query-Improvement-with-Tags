<p>Let's rewrite this with a proper JOIN, and add a NOT on the condition to exclude :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.field_1, a.field_2, b.field_3, b.field_4
  FROM tbl_a AS a JOIN tbl_b AS b ON (a.field_1 = b.field_3)
WHERE NOT (a.field_1 IN (1,2,3,4) AND a.field_date &lt; NOW())
</code></pre>

<p>Since NOT( X AND Y ) is equivalent to (NOT X) OR (NOT Y) you can rewrite this as :</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.field_1, a.field_2, b.field_3, b.field_4
  FROM tbl_a AS a JOIN tbl_b AS b ON (a.field_1 = b.field_3)
WHERE a.field_1 NOT IN (1,2,3,4) OR a.field_date &gt;= NOW())
</code></pre>

<p>But we'd also need to know if any of field_1 or field_date can be NULL. If that is the case, the expression "foo NOT IN (blah)" returns NULL if foo IS NULL. So you'd need to be more specific about that.</p>
