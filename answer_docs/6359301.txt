<p>My bad. You couldn't find the error. The project had one messages.properties in /WEB-INF/classes and a second set(but without default properties) directly in the web content directory with the same names. </p>

<p>So i guess he took the only existing default messages.properties from the classes folder and the messages_de/en.properties from the web-content folder. </p>
