<p>As discussed in <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/painting/index.html" rel="nofollow"><em>Painting in AWT and Swing</em></a>, this is the expected behavior when painting in AWT. In particular, a system-triggered painting operation occurs when a component is resized. As @rjacks notes, you need to <code>dispose()</code> any resources created in <code>paint()</code>.</p>
