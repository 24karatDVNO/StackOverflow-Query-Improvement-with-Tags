<p>Why bother with an array?  Declare an int as a cursor</p>

<p>Assuming you want them across row 1</p>

<pre><code>dim col as integer
dim Acount as integer (etc)
'get Acount, Bcount etc from form
for col 1 =1 to Acount
    cells(1,col).value = "GA" &amp; col
next
for col =1 Acount to Bcount-1
    cells(1,col).value = "GB" &amp; col
next
</code></pre>

<p>etc</p>
