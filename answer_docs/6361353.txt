<p>I will suggest you run <code>print_r($_SERVER)</code> on your script and look into the output of that array. You'll find your URL in one of the elements of that array, perhaps $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] is the one you'll need.</p>

<pre><code>switch ($_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']) {
    case 'www.url1.com':
        // print image 1;
        break;
    case 'www.url2.com':
        // print image 2;
        break;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I think you do not need to give http:// because $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] does not contain it, but please verify it.</p>
