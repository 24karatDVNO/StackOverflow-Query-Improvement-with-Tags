<p>I would say it definitely depends on the program. I would tend to to go with number 1, because it would be way easier to maintain.</p>

<p>But option 2 could be viable depending on which kind of operations you are doing, if they are a-like operation then it would be better to have them on the same file. If they are completely different operations it makes a lot more sense to have them on a separate file.</p>

<p>Also this is premature optimization.</p>
