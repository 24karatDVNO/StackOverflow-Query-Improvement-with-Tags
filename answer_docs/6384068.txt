<p>Yes, you can, by <code>cmd</code> command:</p>

<ul>
<li>Type <code>notepad text1.txt</code>: this creates a new notepad file and you can type anything inside, save it then close.</li>
<li>Type <code>notepad text1.txt:hidden.txt</code>: you can type anything and save it. This means <code>hidden.txt</code> become inside <code>text1.txt</code> but you can not see it. Why? Long story :) These are about NTFS issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also you can do it for <code>.exe</code> files.</p>
