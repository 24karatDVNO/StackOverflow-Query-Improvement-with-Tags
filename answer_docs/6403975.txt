<p>I'm don't know MySQL internals at all, but Darhazer's explanation looks like the winner to me. When the non-indexed field is added, the entire row must be retrieved. And your rows are <em>very</em> wide. I can't quite tell from the names how (if at all) it is denormalized, but I suspect it is. <code>site name</code> and <code>site sku</code> smell like they belong in a <code>site</code> lookup table with an FK. <code>rebates found amount</code> and <code>rebates found count</code> sound like statistics that should be coming from a join to a separate <code>product rebate</code> table. etc.</p>
