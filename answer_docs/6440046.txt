<p>FTP can be more tricky for the user than a plain html upload form, but would be the preferred way to upload in my opinion (robust protocol, resume support etc.)</p>

<p>For a nice html upload form, you could have a look at <a href="http://www.plupload.com/" rel="nofollow">plupload</a>, which offers a wide variety of options for client side plugins. It supports graceful degradation, and in the case of html5 file uploads support, it also supports chunking the upload.</p>
