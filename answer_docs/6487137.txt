<p>If have not used Xcode but I don't see why you should not be able to do so. If you want to build for non mac machines you just have to compile your code with the proper flags, and be mindful of the libraries available on the other system. As for frameworks, you won't find them on non mac machines so you shouldn't use -framework option in gcc.</p>
