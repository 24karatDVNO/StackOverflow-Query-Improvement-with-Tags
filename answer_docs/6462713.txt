<p>You can't see the images because eclipse has deployed your webapp to a server and your images are being uploaded to the server. </p>

<p>You can save them directly to your workspace by using:</p>

<pre><code>System.getEnv("user.home")+"/workspace/MyProj/Library/"
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>context.getRealPath("/")+"/Library/";
</code></pre>
