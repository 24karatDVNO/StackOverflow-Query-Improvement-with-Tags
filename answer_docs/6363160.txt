<p>Rather than create a new table, try creating a view. Views aren't actually tables, but can be used very much like them! </p>

<p>So, try; </p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW myItemView 
as 
  SELECT 
     Item.ItemLookupCode
     ,(Item.Quantity - ItemDynamic.Quantity as Quantity
  FROM Item 
  INNER JOIN ItemDynamic ON Item.ItemID=ItemDynamic.ItemID
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you should be able to select * from myitemview to get what you're looking for. </p>
