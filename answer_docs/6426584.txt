<p>It's not exactly an answer, but maybe it's help someone. I circumvented the problem by using two side by side image views. If all you want to do is see the images (which was my case) then To get the images to touch in the border I used fitScaleType fitend for the image on the left and fitstart for the image on the right (Landscape mode was fixed in my case).</p>
