<p>Select the child items first and then include the parent.  Then at the end, just select a list of the parent entity that you were after.</p>

<pre><code>Messages.Include("MessageThread")
        .Where(m =&gt; m.FromAccount == userAccount
                 || m.ToAccount == userAccount)
        .Select(m =&gt; m.MessageThread)
</code></pre>

<p>If you leave the select off the end you get a list of messages with the parents included. It depends on what you where after.</p>

<p>OR.... (this, which is a bit neater)</p>

<pre><code>MessageThreads.Where(s =&gt; s.Messages.Any( m =&gt; m.FromAccount == userAccount
                                            || m.ToAccount == userAccount))
</code></pre>
