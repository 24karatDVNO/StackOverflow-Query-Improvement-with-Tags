<p>I can't help you with the button thing, but the most commom way of interacting with other desktop applications if there is no public API is using the <code>Robot</code> class. With a <code>Robot</code> you have control over the cursor (point&amp;click) as well as keyboard input.</p>

<p>I don't know which application you want to hook into, but some expose data and methods via DBUS. It would be less costly.</p>
