<p>Usually images in MATLAB are just matrices.  So you can glue them back together with the usual horizontal and vertical concatenation commands:</p>

<pre><code>WholeImage = [ NorthWest NorthEast; ...
               SouthWest SouthEast ];
</code></pre>

<p>Assuming your image was broken up into four pieces, this will put them back together.</p>

<p>If you had a broken it up into a variable number of pieces and stored the pieces in a cell array, then <code>cell2mat</code> should be helpful in gluing the pieces back together.</p>
