<p>I think using symfony for this, is the wrong approach. Using Sockets would be much easier. </p>

<p>For example have a look at <a href="http://nodejs.org/" rel="nofollow">nodejs</a> or <a href="http://www.ape-project.org/" rel="nofollow">ape-project</a> (comet) </p>

<p>they both are able to handle much more current users than apache, lighttpd or nginx...</p>
