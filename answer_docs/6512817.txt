<p>Let me answer it myself...</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Not all databases were showing because there were three databases engine running on the machine. The user databases were imported into the wrong server not the EXPRESS one that I was using.</p></li>
<li><p>As for connectivity errors, obviously if there is no database, no connection can be established. I am getting more targeted errors now regarding the connection though.</p></li>
