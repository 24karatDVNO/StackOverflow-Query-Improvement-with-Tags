<p>The indexPath parameter of the commitEditingStyle:... method <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/UIKit/Reference/NSIndexPath_UIKitAdditions/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">has the section and row</a> of the cell. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question, can you clarify what you mean by 'delete it from the associated array' - do you have one array for each section in your table?</p>
