<p>Of course, you <em>could</em> try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO TableA (RecordID, Value)
SELECT RecordID, GETDATE()
FROM OPENQUERY(
  <i>yourserver</i>,
  'UPDATE TableA
  SET SomeField = 1
  OUTPUT inserted.RecordID
  WHERE RecordID IN (SELECT TOP (5) RecordID FROM TableA)'
)
</code></pre>

<p>But there's a couple of issues with the approach:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You'd need to create a linked server <code>yourserver</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>The 'remote' query wouldn't be very swift.</p></li>
<li><p>You'd have hard time replacing <code>TOP (5)</code> with <code>TOP (@Something)</code>. Actually you'd most probably have to turn the entire statement into a dynamic query. (That's right, you'd have to put the already dynamic UPDATE inside another dynamic query.)</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I expect, with the last issue the one-statement limitation would finally be broken.</p>

<p>So, instead, why not have it like this:</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @tmpRecords TABLE (RecordID int);

UPDATE TableA
SET SomeField = 1
OUTPUT inserted.RecordID INTO @tmpRecords (RecordID)
WHERE RecordID IN (SELECT TOP (@Something) RecordID FROM TableA);

INSERT INTO TableA (RecordID, SomeDateColumn)
SELECT RecordID, GETDATE()
FROM @tmpRecords;
</code></pre>
