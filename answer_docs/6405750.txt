<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.listbox.selectedindexchanged.aspx" rel="nofollow">SelectedIndexChanged</a> event on ListBox, it might do what you want.  In fact the sample code in the docuemntation shows how to select an item in a second ListBox when an item is selected in the first ListBox so that should give you some idea.</p>
