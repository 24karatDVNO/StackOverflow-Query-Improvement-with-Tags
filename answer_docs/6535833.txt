<p>What is the VerticalAlignment of a ListBox by default? You might need to set the vertical alignment to Stretch.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView                 
        x:Name="MyList"
        ItemsSource="{Binding}"
        Grid.Row="1"
        VerticalAlignment="Stretch"
        /&gt;    
</code></pre>
