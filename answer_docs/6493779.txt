<p>What you are actually trying to do is to UNPIVOT a table... You already have in a normalized mode, but want them columnar per each supplier for like a side-by-side comparison and each column... you would also have to have a "definitive" number of suppliers you wanted to compare which would get into a VERY ugly / long SQL command...  It COULD be done, but QUITE ugly...</p>

<p>Is this your intent??? and if so, would you be supplying a specific list of suppliers you wanted in a side-by-side comparison?</p>
