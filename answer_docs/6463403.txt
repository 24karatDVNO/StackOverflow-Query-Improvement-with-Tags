<p>For binaries, you can use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to intercept whatever C library functions you like and take whatever action you want (abort, log an error but proceed, etc.)</p>

<p>During development, you can also use valgrind to do the same.</p>

<p>For some sample code and references, see the answers to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69859/how-could-i-intercept-linux-sys-calls">how could I intercept linux sys calls?</a></p>
