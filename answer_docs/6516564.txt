<p>On iOS 4 the app does not exit it goes to background. And when you tap on the icon the app resumes from where you left it. </p>

<p>If you want to reset something when it goes in background you need to implement custom code in appDelegate methods:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)applicationDidEnterBackground:(UIApplication *)application
{
    /*
     Use this method to release shared resources, save user data, invalidate timers, and store enough application state information to restore your application to its current state in case it is terminated later. 
     If your application supports background execution, this method is called instead of applicationWillTerminate: when the user quits.
     */
}
- (void)applicationWillEnterForeground:(UIApplication *)application
{
    /*
     Called as part of the transition from the background to the inactive state; here you can undo many of the changes made on entering the background.
     */
}
</code></pre>
