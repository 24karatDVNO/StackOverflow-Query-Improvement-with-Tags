<p>Are you talking about web site demos?  I'm not sure I understand the problem.  If they're web sites, I'm sure you already know you can simply use a single address with different urls, eg, <a href="http://mbp.local/demo1" rel="nofollow">http://mbp.local/demo1</a>, <a href="http://mbp.local/demo2" rel="nofollow">http://mbp.local/demo2</a>, etc.  If it is something else entirely, you can use the Mac's local host file to point multiple fqdns to a single IP address on your local network, but it would be best to have a static IP.  Alternatively, you could edit your DNS or WINS server to do the address translation.</p>
