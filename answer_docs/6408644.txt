<p>The compiler does not know which function implementation to take, since they both fit, and the details of what types are used for template classes are in the error message.</p>

<p>It looks like you can eliminate one method, this one:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt; class T &gt;
inline void store( char** buffer, T data ){

    memcpy( *buffer, &amp;data, sizeof( T ) );
    buffer += sizeof(T);
}
</code></pre>
