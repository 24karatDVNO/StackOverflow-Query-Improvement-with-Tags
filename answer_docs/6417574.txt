<p>By convention a custom <code>swap</code> offers no-throw guarantee. I don't know about <code>std::swap</code>. My impression of the committee's work on that is that it was all political, so it would not surprise me if they somewhere had defined <code>duck</code> as <code>bug</code>, or similar political word-game maneuvers. So I would not rely on <em>any answer here</em> unless it provides a detailed blow by blow quoting from the C++0x to-be-standard, down the smallest detail (so as to be sure no <code>bug</code>).</p>
