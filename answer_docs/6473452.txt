<p>As an aside, I have to support a legacy app that uses both jQuery and Prototype.  If my javascript throws nearly any error, Firebug and Chrome will report it as an error in Prototype.js.  Since I've almost completely undone Prototype, it's never the real problem.</p>

<p>In the circumstances, I assume that it's NEVER prototype and start debugging my own code that's fired by this page.</p>
