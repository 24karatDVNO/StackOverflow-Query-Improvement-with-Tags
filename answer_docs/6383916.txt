<p>Still failed to find anything suitable :(</p>

<p>While I can sink data at this rate in MySQL, it starts to get a bit lumpy when I'm trying to consolidate it / remove old low level data. So I guess I'm going to have to look at building the aggregation layer on top of the DBMS and switch to a noSQL system - and write it all myself :(</p>
