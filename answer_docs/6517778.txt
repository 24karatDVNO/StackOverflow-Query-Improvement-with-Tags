<p>I tried your code on my laptop and the QWebView had focus already - once Google had loaded I could type and my text appeared in the text box.</p>

<p>If it is a focus problem then as QWebView inherits QWidget you can call its <a href="http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/qwidget.html#setFocus" rel="nofollow">setFocus()</a> method. Here is your code with an extra line calling the QWebView's setFocus method once a page has loaded:</p>

<pre><code>import sys
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *
from PyQt4.QtWebKit import *

app = QApplication(sys.argv)
web = QWebView()
web.loadFinished.connect(web.setFocus)
web.showFullScreen()
web.load(QUrl("http://www.google.com/"))
sys.exit(app.exec_())
</code></pre>
