<p>Yes it still is, GPUs are massively parallel so you can't really say that you write 'one' pixel at a time, there are also cache systems that are populated when you ready a texture. If you write to the same texture, the cache would need to be synchronized, and so on.</p>

<p>For some insight, you can take a look at the <a href="http://developer.download.nvidia.com/opengl/specs/GL_NV_texture_barrier.txt" rel="nofollow">NV_texture_barrier</a> OpenGL extension, that is meant to add some flexibility is this area.</p>
