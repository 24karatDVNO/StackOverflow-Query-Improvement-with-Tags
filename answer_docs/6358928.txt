<p>Assuming ID can give you the last 4 rows.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SUM([SUM])
FROM
    (
    SELECT TOP 4 [SUM] FROM myTable ORDER BY ID DESC
    ) foo
</code></pre>

<p>Each time you query it, it will read the last 4 rows.</p>

<p>If this is wrong (e.g. you want the sum of each consecutive 4 rows), then please give sample output</p>
