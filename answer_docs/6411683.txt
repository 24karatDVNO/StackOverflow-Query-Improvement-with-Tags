<p>I think your fitness function is too simple.  I would play with using two variables, one the size distance and the other your "hamdist".  The further the size difference is, the more it effects the total fitness.  So add the two together with some percentage constant.</p>

<p>I'm also not very familiar with python, but it looks to me that this is not what you're doing.</p>
