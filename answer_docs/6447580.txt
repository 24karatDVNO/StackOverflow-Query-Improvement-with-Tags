<p>You can download the Firebug plugin (http://getfirebug.com/) if you have Firefox. Using this plugin, you can view the CSS of individual elements on the page by hovering over them and pressing ctrl+shift+c.</p>

<p>You may also view paddings, margins, and heights via the "Layout" tab as well as edit CSS and see updates immediately as live, local changes. That allows for rapid CSS debugging.</p>
