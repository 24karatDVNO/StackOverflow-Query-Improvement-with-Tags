<p>On a desptop, definitely OpenGL, without Web before or ES after.</p>

<p>You also don't need to worry if your system doesn't have a 3.x driver or you don't have 3.x hardware, as you can use shaders and all the like in OpenGL 2.0/2.1, too. So the answer is definitely OpenGL 3.x/2.x!</p>

<p>When you're working on a desktop and don't need to program embedded systems or websites, then there is just completely no reason to use WebGL or OpenGL ES, as these are just subsets of OpenGL 2.0 for specific purposes.</p>
