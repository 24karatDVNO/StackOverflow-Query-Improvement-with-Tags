<p>Overriding toString to be able to print out the object in a readable way when it is later read from the file.</p>

<p>Sorry, couldn't resist. In all seriousness, toStrings are valuable to be overridden for any Java class. However, I would wager a DTO in particular is good to have a toString, because the object is meant to transfer data. Often, this means printing out the data into readable format.</p>
