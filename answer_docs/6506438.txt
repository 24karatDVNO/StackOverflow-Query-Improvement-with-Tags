<p>You will always have to create a new list and add your contact to it. A single contact is not the same as a list of contacts and you cant (and shouldnt be able) to cast directly to it. </p>

<p>You may want to create another class that inherits from <code>List&lt;contact&gt;</code> which you could instanciate and it load the contacts you need on the constructor.</p>
