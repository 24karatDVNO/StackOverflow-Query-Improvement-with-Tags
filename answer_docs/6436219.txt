<p>First example cannot work until you do this:</p>

<pre><code>Dim u as User = Ctype(Session("User"),User)
u.name = "new name"
(From x in ctx.Users).First()
ctx.Users.ApplyCurrentValues(u)
ctx.SaveChanges
</code></pre>

<p>ApplyCurrentValues only take values from passed object and copies them to the same object type which must be loaded and attached to the context.</p>

<p>Second example shown by @Mlantosca cannot work because you are storing entity in session and you didn't detach it. To make it work you must use:</p>

<pre><code>Dim u as User = (From x in ctx.Users).First()
ctx.Detach(u)
Session("user") = u
</code></pre>
