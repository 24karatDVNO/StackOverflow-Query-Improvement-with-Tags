<pre><code>$var3 = "abc";
return $var3;
</code></pre>

<p>That's pointless. You're <code>return</code>ing a <em>value</em>, not a variable. <code>return "abc";</code> is perfectly fine.</p>

  <p>Is it ok to either return a value or return false?</p>

<p>Yes, that's perfectly fine for a simple case such as this.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How can i check the function did return the $var3?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As said above, the function returns the <em>value <code>"abc"</code></em>, not <code>$var3</code>. You're saving it in a new variable <code>$value</code>. This variable is definitely <em>set</em> (you just created it right there), so there's no need for <code>isset</code> or <code>empty</code>. Just test whether its value is <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> (or whatever else you want to test for). So the way you're doing it in fine.</p>
