<p>When a vector stores objects, it stores a <em>copy</em> of the original object that was passed in. So when you do something like this</p>

<pre><code>yourClass yourObj;
std::vector&lt;yourClass&gt; yourVector;
yourvector.push_back(yourObj);
yourvector[0].myFunction();
</code></pre>

<p>only the object at <code>yourvector[0]</code> changes because it is a copy of the original.</p>
