<p>If the two lines of code you posted above fall inside a loop (for / Do While / Loop While) then make sure to include </p>

<pre><code>DoEvents
</code></pre>

<p>to allow the program to handle events (like mouse clicks, keyboard, form re-size and minimize, etc.) while it is busy processing the rest of the code.</p>

<pre><code>a.Read from socket
DoEvents
b.update database
</code></pre>
