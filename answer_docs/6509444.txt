<p>According to the <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.controller.action.html" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> (under "Pre- and Post-Dispatch Hooks"), calling _forward() in preDispatch() will skip the action.</p>

<p>Specifically about preDispatch(): "its primary purpose is to make decisions about whether or not the requested action should be dispatched. If not, you should then _forward() to another action, or throw an exception."</p>
