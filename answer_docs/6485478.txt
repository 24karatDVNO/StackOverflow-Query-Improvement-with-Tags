<p>Assuming you are talking about the method list at the top of an editor window: not in XCode 4 - scripting is broke so there is no way to applescript it either. The list appears in order of the methods in your source file. File a <a href="http://bugreport.apple.com" rel="nofollow">bugreport</a> asking for this as a feature, in theory it shouldn't be difficult for Apple to implement since the index of methods is already built.</p>
