<p>it's a bit of an usual approach of trying to 'grab' the active outlook object... Especially, if there isn't an active object.  A more standard approach is something to the effect of:</p>

<pre><code>outlookApplication = new Application();
outlookNamespace = m_OutlookApplication.GetNamespace("mapi");

// If an outlook app is already open, then it will reuse that
// session. Else it will perform a fresh logon.
outlookNamespace.Logon(accountName, password, true, true);
</code></pre>
