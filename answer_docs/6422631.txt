<p>You could download XML ValidatorBuddy from <a href="http://www.xml-tools.com" rel="nofollow">xml-tools.com</a> and use the "Create XML directory structure" feature to create formated XML from your files and folders of almost any size you want. I hope the trial period of 2 weeks is enough for you to finish your task.</p>
