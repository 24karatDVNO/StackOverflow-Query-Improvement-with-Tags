<p>I'm not really clear on what you want to do, either -> but are you familiar with the concept of ORMs, for example NHibernate, are you trying to map those entites to a relational database?
You can have abstractions like those with simple NHibernate session:</p>

<pre><code>IEntity someEntity = new Customer("John", "Doe");
session.Save(someEntity);
</code></pre>

<p>provided that you map the entity to the database...</p>
