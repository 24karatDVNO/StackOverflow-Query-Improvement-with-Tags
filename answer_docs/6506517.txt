<p>The correct solution best fulfills the requirements and the requirements of every situation will be unique. This is probably the simplest way to go about it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a large one dimensional array
populated with "real" random values.</li>
<li>"seed" your pseudo-random generator by
calculating the starting index with
system time.</li>
<li>Iterate through the array and return
the value for each call to your
function.</li>
<li>Wrap around when it reaches the end.</li>
</ul>
