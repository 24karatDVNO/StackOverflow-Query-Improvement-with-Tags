<p>I did get an answer to this question for <em>some</em> stack traces. (From the looks of this question that may be all I get.) These are the ones that terminate with an <code>lr</code> (link register) address. See my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6460094/stack-traces-stop-at-the-leaf-register-lr/6487769#6487769">other question/answer</a>.</p>
