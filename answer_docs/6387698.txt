<p>There's no general way of doing this, and it's not always possible -- for instance, if the machine is PXE booted, or if it's an embedded system, the kernel may not exist on disk at all. On an x86 system, you can make a guess by attempting to parse the lilo/grub config, but this won't give reliable results.</p>
