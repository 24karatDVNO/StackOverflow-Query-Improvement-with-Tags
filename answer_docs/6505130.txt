<p>You could also create a <code>ControllerA</code> instance var in your <code>ControllerB</code> and then pass the <code>ControllerA (self)</code> to <code>ControllerB</code>(ex: by a method) before call <code>pushViewController</code> from A to B. You can do the same from B to C...etc; i think the best solution is that of Jhaliya in case you want to work with navigationControllers.</p>
