<p>You have a variety of options.</p>

<ol>
<li>If the API is common to ALL pages, just embed the JavaScript in the master page</li>
<li>As a variation of #1, put the code in a .js file and link in the tags in the master page</li>
<li>Create a content area and include</li>
<li>Create a literal control and include in the page controls collection</li>
</ol>

<p>I am certain there are other means of accomplishing this. Which do you choose of the above? Depends on whether you have this on EVERY page (#1,#2) or just some (#3,#4). It also depends on whether you like to work in tags (#3) or declarative "programming" or in code (#4).</p>
