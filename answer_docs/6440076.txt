<p>you can't put script tags <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> in a textarea you can't even put any html tag in a textarea.</p>

<p>It will consider it as the default value ;) </p>

<p>And escaping it with <code>&amp;gt;</code> our <code>&amp;lt;</code> will nt change anything because it's already escaped in the textarea to show it as simple  text</p>
