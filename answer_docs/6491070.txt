<p>Interactions between ASP.net and jquery can be a little tricky because you are dealing with server side vs. client side.  What I suggest you do is create a list from the server side (e.g. produce a static JSON list in javascript or use AJAX), then use jquery to create your charts for each staff in your JSON list.</p>
