<p>set_time_limit() may be denyed (it has no effect if PHP is in safe_mode). On a side note, the sleep() time is not included in the time limit, so if you remove the sleep and the time script is working is changed, probably it's time limit. To check if this is a time limit (other option is CPU-time limit), <a href="http://php.net/register_shutdown_function" rel="nofollow">register shutdown function</a> and check <a href="http://php.net/connection_status" rel="nofollow">connection status</a> (value of 2 means time out)</p>
