<p>Grails is a web framework so options 2 and 3 are less than ideal. If having the file that is ftped immediately available in your application option 1 is the quickest and simplest solution of the 3 I think.</p>

<p>Another option is to find an open source FTP server (there are several) and modify it to import the document into your system directly. This will allow your client to use the protocol they prefer (FTP) and still get the file into your application in real time. </p>

<p>Still another option is to provide an FTP like client that will use your grails application as the server. Whether this is suitable or not depends on why the client insists on using FTP which you should determine up front to make sure your solution works for them.</p>
