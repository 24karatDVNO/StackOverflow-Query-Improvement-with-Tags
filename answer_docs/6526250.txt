<p>I'm still open to a better answer, but I made my own <code>CALayoutManager</code> subclass, which implements a custom <code>-layoutSublayersOfLayer</code> to place the sublayers' frames exactly where I want them. I also made a <code>+layoutManager</code> method so my custom layout manager can simply be swapped for the <code>CAConstraintLayoutManager</code>.</p>
