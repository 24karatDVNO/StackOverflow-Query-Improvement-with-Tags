<p>Let answer without restricting to JavaScript.</p>

<p>There are several ways of using a function as a variable / parameter, one of them is nested inside another function is called a "closure".</p>

<p>You can check a complete description of a "closure" here:</p>

<p>I suggest use the separate functions (case 1) for very long extended code, and nested function (case 2) for short code.</p>
