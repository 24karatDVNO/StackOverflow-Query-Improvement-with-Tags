<p>My impression (from experience) with jQTouch is that, it was developed for iOS Safari; but since Android browsers and iOS Safari are both WebKit-based, a lot of functions work on both. If you truly want this app to be functional on Android, your best bet is probably to switch to <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Sencha Touch</a> or <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">jQuery Mobile</a>. Take a look at the following two posts:</p>

</ul>

<p>If you want more access than what a browser provides (e.g. accelerometer), just build a simple native wrapper for each platform.</p>
