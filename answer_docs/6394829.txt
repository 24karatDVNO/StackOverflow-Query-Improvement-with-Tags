<p>"no scraping intended" - You are intending to scrape. =)</p>

<p>The only reasonable ethics-based reasons one should not take it from their website is:</p>

<ol>
<li>They may wish to display advertisements or important security notices to users</li>
<li>This may make their statistics inaccurate</li>
</ol>

<p>In terms of hammering their site, it is probably not an issue. But if it is:</p>

<ul>
<li>You probably wish to scrape the minimal amount necessary (e.g. make the minimal number of HTTP requests), and not hammer the server too often.</li>
<li>You probably do not wish to have all your apps query the website; you could have your own website query them via a cronjob. This will allow you better control in case they change their formatting, or let you throw "service currently unavailable" errors to your users, just by changing your website; it introduces another point of failure, but it's probably worth it. This way if there's a bug, people don't need to update their apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>But the best thing you can do is to talk to the website, asking them what is best. They may have a hidden API they would allow you to use, and perhaps have allowed others to use as well.</p>
