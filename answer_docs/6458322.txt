<p>Here's what it says:</p>

<pre><code>myElements = document.getElementById('idName').elements 
//Find the form with the id="idName"
//and gather all the form elements in an object/array

//because there could be more than one element in the form, 
//you will need to loop through the object

//loop now and for each element that is a checkbox
//do the following, where it says DO SOMETHING

for (var eachElement in myElements) {
    if (myElement[eachElement].type == 'checkbox' ) {

    //DO SOMETHING

     }
 }
</code></pre>
