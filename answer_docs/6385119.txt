<p>I do know a workaround that is a bit laborious. A similar solution as I suggested: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6226231/imagettftext-and-the-euro-sign/6312175#6312175">imagettftext-and-the-euro-sign</a>.</p>

<p>In my case this could work as I'm really just looking for a way to generate some very simple images with text. It averts my problem but of course doesn't fix the underlying issue.</p>
