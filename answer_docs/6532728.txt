<p>It sounds like you may want to have a look at Streaminsight <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/r2-complex-event.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/r2-complex-event.aspx</a>. I can't say I know too much about it but if you google Allan Mitchell and Streaminsight or have a look on SQLIS.com he has done a number of demo videos using it.</p>
