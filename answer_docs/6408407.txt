<p>Unless you are going to implement your own keyboard (not recommended - it's wrong on so many levels including internationalisation/foreign language support), you'll need to either use an instance of UITextField or UITextView or subclass one of these classes.  AFAIK (and I've looked into it in some depth) there is no other way to trigger the on-screen keyboard in iOS.</p>
