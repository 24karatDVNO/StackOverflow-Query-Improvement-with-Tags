<p>I don't know what is the cause of this particular error, but I was suffering with this issue also.</p>

<p>I was able to solve this using a DataProvider, in my case an AsyncDataProvider to be more specific. However, you can use the ListDataProvider in your example. You can find more info about DataProviders at <a href="http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/DevGuideUiCellWidgets.html#data-provider" rel="nofollow">Google code developer's guide</a>.</p>
