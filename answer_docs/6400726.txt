<p>You could also use Resume Next to continue processing the next instructions</p>

<pre><code>Public Sub MyMain()
    On Error Resume Next
    aNumber = someNumber / 0    'Divide by Zero will yield a run time error
    If Err&lt;&gt;0 Then         'In case you want to re-act with the error to the user
        MsgBox "Divide by Zero Occurred"
    End If
    On Error Goto 0    'This will un-do the effect of On Error Resume Next, meaning
                       ' that if any other error occurs, there will be a runtime error
                       ' use this if you intentionally want to
End Sub
