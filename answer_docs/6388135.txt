<p>As long as the path you are trying to access is under the Virtual Directory your application is in, you should be able to access it in Medium Trust.  Are you sure your application identity has folder create permission?</p>

<p>Edit: I might have read the doc above wrong.  See this link as well, it appears you only have Read, Write, Append, and PathDiscovery permissions :(</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>FileIOPermission is restricted. This
  means you can only access files in
  your application's virtual directory
  hierarchy. Your application is granted
  Read, Write, Append, and PathDiscovery
  permissions for your application's
  virtual directory hierarchy.</p>
