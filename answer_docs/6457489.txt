<p>I had the same problem.  I was using a join table and all I had with a row id field and two foreign keys.  I don't know the exact caused but I did the following</p>

<ol>
<li>Upgraded MySQL to community 5.5.13</li>
<li>Rename the class and table</li>
<li><p>Make sure I had hashcode and equals methods</p>

<pre><code>@Entity 
@Table(name = "USERGROUP")
public class UserGroupBean implements Serializable {
private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy=GenerationType.AUTO)
@Column(name = "USERGROUP_ID")
private Long usergroup_id;

@Column(name = "USER_ID")   
private Long user_id;

@Column(name = "GROUP_ID")
private Long group_id;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>
