<p>You could pull the email addresses from the database, and use them to build a list of option tags inside your select tag. Add another option tag at the end of the list that says something like "Input another address". Then use a bit of javascript that causes a text field to be revealed when the last item in the list is selected. </p>

<p>Make sure the hidden input is revealed by default, and hidden using javascript, so that if javascript is not available, the page will still be usable.</p>
