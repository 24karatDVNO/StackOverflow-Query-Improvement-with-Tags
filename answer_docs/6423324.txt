<p>What do you mean by active? An application is either running or terminated, and you have 2 hooks to change the behaviour of the application <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html#onCreate%28%29" rel="nofollow"><code>onCreate()</code></a>  and <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html#onTerminate%28%29" rel="nofollow"><code>onTerminate()</code></a></p>

<p>On the other hand, an application has different components, like activities, and an activity has a more complex <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#ActivityLifecycle" rel="nofollow">lifecycle</a> with similar hooks.</p>
