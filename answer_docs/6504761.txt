<p>If you don't put @MappedSuperclass on your class you are extending from, the class properties will never by persisted.
You can provide getter methods for certain properties, and place the annotations on the properties instead of the fields. The @Id annotation determines if you want the fields or the properties. In JPA 2 you can also use the @Access annotation.</p>
