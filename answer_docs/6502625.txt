<p>Enemies that do not have a weapon associated can be accomplished by:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  *
FROM    Enemies
LEFT JOIN Weapons ON Enemies.ID = Weapons.RefID
WHERE   Weapons.ID IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>It might be of note that your original query might not give you what you want in that if two weapons are associated to a single enemy you might get duplicates when counting, another possibility for your original query might be:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT  DISTINCT Enemies.ID
FROM    Weapons 
JOIN    Enemies ON Weapons.RefID=Enemies.ID
</code></pre>
