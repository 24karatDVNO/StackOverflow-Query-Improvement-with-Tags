<p>In your first example with YUI the object literal is used simply as a dictionary of options. It's useful in a language where there are no named parameters and a function takes many arguments. Also it's easier to play with defaults this way in JavaScript.</p>

<p>Take the following example:</p>

<pre><code>function myf(options) {
  var url = options['url'] || 'http://...';
  var method = options['method'] || 'get';
  // ...
}

// Now you can pass only what you deem necessary in the function
myf({ 'url' : 'http://stackoverflow.com' });
myf({ 'method' : 'post' });
myf({});
</code></pre>

<p>This method is there for it's practical purposes.</p>
