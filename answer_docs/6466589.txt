<p>not sure if this really works, but you could try to join the keywords table with itself for each searchterm, eg something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT searchterm1.key_page_id as page_id FROM KEYWORDS searchterm1 
INNER JOIN KEYWORDS searchterm2 
ON (searchterm1.key_page_id = searchterm2.key_page_id) 
WHERE searchterm1.key_name='purz' AND searchterm2.key_name='puzy';
</code></pre>

<p>you wouldn't even need to join with the PAGES table,  unless you need page_name returned as well</p>
