<p>You are probably going to <em>have</em> to return from the event before the cursor is restored.  If you do not want to use a thread maybe a timer will do.  In the <code>tick</code> event check for a flag indicating work to be done.  In the drop event just store all the required data in a variable.</p>

<p>But I would rather go with a thread.</p>
