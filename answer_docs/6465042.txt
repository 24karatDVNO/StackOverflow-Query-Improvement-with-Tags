<p>Maybe you have a hardware problem.</p>

<p>I had the same problem on my old system (AMD 1800 MHz CPU ,1GB RAM ,Windows 7 Ultimate) ,until I changed the <strong>2x 512 MB RAM</strong> to <strong>2x 1GB RAM</strong>. Haven't had any problems since. Also other (minor) problems disappeared. Guess those two 512 MB modules didn't like each other that much ,because <strong>2x 512 MB + 1GB</strong> or <strong>1x 512 MB + 2x 1GB</strong> didn't work properly either. </p>
