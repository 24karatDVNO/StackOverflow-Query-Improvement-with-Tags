<p>This is a very annoying issue, I spend a lot of hours in trying to find a solution but at the end this was corrected for me by removing the Entitlements.plist (as I understood it is only needed when deploying for ad hoc), removing any duplicate field in the Info.plist, setting the target to "Distribution" with the correct configuration of the certificates and using the method of "Archive" then "Validate" and at last "Submmit" in XCode</p>
