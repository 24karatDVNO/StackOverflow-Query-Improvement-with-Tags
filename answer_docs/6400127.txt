<p>Try with gem install with -V option, maybe you'll see where it's installing everything.  It installs rails for me in /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/rails-3.0.9/bin/rails and /usr/bin/rails.  It's hacky but you could copy rails from the first location to the second if it doesn't automatically add for you.  Best idea is probably to nuke it and start fresh.</p>
