<p>Without knowing a use-case for your question it's hard to answer it:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to send additional data to the client a bit later you can do a JS timeout on the client side with a handler that will make a new HTTP request to PHP.</li>
<li>If you want to schedule some task for a later time you can store that in a database and poll the DB in regular intervalls. It's not the best peforming solution but relatively easy to implement.</li>
</ul>
