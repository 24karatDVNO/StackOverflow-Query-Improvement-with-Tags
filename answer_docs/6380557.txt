<p>So, the animation of the transition is slower/choppier than you'd like? I'm guessing from the class name <code>image</code> that the problem might just be the fact that it's an image, even with hardware acceleration kicking in; my team at work has struggled with this sometimes in doing UI simulations/demos on iOS. You might try, just as a test, replacing the image with an identically-sized <code>div</code> and seeing if it moves more smoothly.</p>
