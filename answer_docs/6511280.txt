<p>You have a syntax error in the query, and/or something else wrong with the database. Within your dbquery function, you'd need to have something like:</p>

<pre><code>$result = mysql_query($sql) or (die(mysql_error());
</code></pre>

<p>which will abort the script and output the reason why the query failed.</p>

<p>However, given your query string, and your data going into it, the error is due to a lack of quotes around your <code>$cat</code> within the query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ... WHERE `cat_slug`=funny;
</code></pre>

<p>Unless your table has a field called "funny", this is a syntax error. You need:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ... WHERE `cat_slug`='funny';
</code></pre>

<p>(note the quotes).</p>
