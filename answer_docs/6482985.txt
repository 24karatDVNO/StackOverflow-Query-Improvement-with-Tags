<p>The C99 standard says explicitly (6.5, p2)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Between the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The expressions <code>i = ++i;</code> and <code>i = i++;</code> both update <code>i</code> twice, which is not allowed.</p>
