<p>It all depends on which compiler/processor you use. If I put your definition in Keil Uvision for 8051, surely would point to ROM because of the "CONST" definer although I could modify with XRAM or CODE. But for ARM depends on address and not definer.
Keil Uvision Example:</p>

<pre><code>// For 8051 Keil 
const char code romdata[2] = {0,1}; //&lt;&lt; this point to ROM/FLASH
const char xram ramdata[2] = {0,1}; // this point to external RAM 
const char romdata[2] = {0,1}; // this point to ROM/FLASH
</code></pre>
