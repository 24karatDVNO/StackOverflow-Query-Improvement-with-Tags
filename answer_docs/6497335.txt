<p>Are you sure the query vars are being set? Can you confirm via firebug that they are being passed? Try using isset() and empty() to verify on the server side they have been set. Also, if echo never turns out what I want I run a var_dump, which will output a lot more details (including data type) and let you know if it is empty or non existent (echo will just output nothing). And your using echo properly.</p>
