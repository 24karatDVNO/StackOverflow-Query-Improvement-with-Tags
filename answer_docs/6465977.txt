<p>If you can get the user to authorize your application who is being replied <strong>to</strong> then you can pull their <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/statuses/mentions" rel="nofollow">mentions timeline</a> and see what of their tweets have replies. You can also use the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api_methods#follow" rel="nofollow">follow parameter</a> for the Streaming API. And last but not least use the Search API like you mentioned but you will have to request the <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/statuses/show/%3aid" rel="nofollow">full status</a> object for each result to see if it is a reply.</p>
