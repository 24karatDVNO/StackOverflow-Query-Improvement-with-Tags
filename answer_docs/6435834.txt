<p>I believe there's no such a thing as a "good programming language for AI". Programming languages are tools, and it really depends what your AI project is about: just choose the most appropriate one for it. For example, if you're going to work with Semantic Web and ontologies, then Java is probably a good choice, because there are a lot of good Java libraries and tools in that area. Conversely, I know that many people working on machine learning use R, because it is a powerful statistical computing environment. Alternatively, if your AI project is about logic programming or computational linguistic, then you should probably have a look at Prolog.</p>

<p>In summary, it really depends on what is your AI project. Tell us more about it, and you'll probably get more precise answers.</p>
