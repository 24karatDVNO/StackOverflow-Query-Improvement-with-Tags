<p>I'm currently having similar issues that could be related to the listen.backlog setting.
I've been finding different posts claiming that -1 can be wrongly interpreted.  I'm currently experimenting with setting listen.backlog to 0 or a high value.  I'll see what the outcome is and keep you posted.</p>

<p>Have you tried correcting the log path as follows?
log/php-error.log (the leading slash makes it look for the /log folder which usually doesn't exist on a Linux system.</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>
