<p>Well it appears that despite a (possibly self-interested?) recommendation from here on SO, the jwplayer folks
perhaps have lost interest in supporting their open-source jwplayer, as their forum reflects dissatisfaction
with my issue here and others.  It seems to be a common complaint on their forum that the jwplayer has noteworthy
shortcomings.  Including:</p>

<ul>
<li>will not work on the Mac OS X  at all</li>
<li>does not work with 3gp either, despite their 'tech notes' claims to the contrary</li>
</ul>

<p>I found recurring complaints along these lines.  With 3gp being very common, and the Mac OS
being no slouch either, I would strongly advise those of you contemplating use of the jwplayer
to look elsewhere as we are doing now for our video playing needs.</p>
