<p>Due to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_hole_principle" rel="nofollow">Pigeon hole principle</a>, you only need to test the first n/2+1 members of the array since the repeated number for certain will be repeated at least twice. Loop through each member, using a hash table to keep track, and stop when there is a member that is repeated twice.</p>
