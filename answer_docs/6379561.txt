<p>With Android, as it turns out, it's a bit more complicated than just determining whether or not you're on an emulator (which can be done using Peter's link above), given the ability, under "Development Settings" to allow Mock Locations (see, for example, <a href="http://www.appbrain.com/app/my-fake-location/com.my.fake.location" rel="nofollow">this app</a> that allows the user to set a mock location that will then be made available to other apps).  </p>

<p>Depending upon the method you're using to retrieve the location provider (e.g., calling <code>LocationManager.getProvider()</code> using the return value from <code>LocationManager.getBestProvider()</code>) you could therefore end up using a Mock Provider. I've been unable to find any definitive method for determining whether a provider is Mock or not (e.g., there's no property of the LocationProvider that indicates it is Mock, no property of the Location that indicates it's fake, etc.).  What you could, however, do is read the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/Settings.Secure.html" rel="nofollow">Secure Settings</a> to determine whether or not ALLOW_MOCK_LOCATION is enabled and not allow your app to function in this case; since the setting is one of the Secure Settings, there is no way to change it programmatically.</p>
