<p>I would use <a href="http://dumbotics.com/2009/12/23/dumbo-on-amazon-emr/" rel="nofollow">dumbo</a>. It is a python wrapper for Hadoop that is compatible with Amazon Elastic MapReduce. Write a little wrapper around your code to integrate with dumbo. Note that you probably need a map-only job with no reduce step.</p>
