<p>As an aside, your <code>delete</code> statement is badly broken.  You can't delete multiple variables in one go, this</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>delete numberOfCourses, credits, score, cumulativeScore;
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>is actually using the C++ comma operator which discards its left-hand side, so only <code>cumulativeScore</code> gets deallocated.</p>
