<p>I used the jquery plugin called jplayer <a href="http://jplayer.org/" rel="nofollow">http://jplayer.org/</a> for a streaming music player and it worked really well - I would definitely recommend it.  One cool thing is that if it's opened in a browser that doesn't support html5, it defaults back to flash.</p>

<p>Also, it's open source, so if you need more / different functionality you could always look at the source and build on it or get inspiration from it.</p>
