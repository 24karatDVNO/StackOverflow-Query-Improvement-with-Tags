<p>I modified it because I am working with a lot of files therefore the solution works great but not for queries dealing with a lot of records. Here is what I worked out. </p>

<p>lets assume I have this records so far:</p>

<pre><code>Select * from table1 WHERE DateInserted = 4
 and Path not in(
        select Path from table1 t1 
        where 
            DateInserted = 4 AND
            Path IN (Select Path from table1 where DateInserted&lt;4) AND
            DateModified IN (Select DateModified from table1 where DateInserted&lt;4)
    )
</code></pre>

<p>and that returns:</p>

<p>this query works out much faster. I will obviously have to change the 4 for a variable in my code but this is just to illustrate the changes that I have done. </p>
