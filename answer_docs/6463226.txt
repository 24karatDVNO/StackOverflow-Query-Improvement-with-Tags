<p>static methods and inner classes don't have any access to the variables of their dynamic counter part, and consequently can't use monitors/synchronize on an instance of their parent class.  Of course this doesn't mean that declaring them and using them is inherently non-thread safe.  It's just that if you need to synchronize any of those static methods on an instance of the parent class, then you need to be sure that you synchronize/lock <em>before</em> entering them or else you must explicitly pass a reference to a parent instance into them.</p>
