<p>In our case this turned out to be a difference between servers. I guess there was a stealth update to CF7 that we picked up on one server and not the other. By stealth I mean that there were two hotfixes issued with the same ID that were different. To fix this our Sys Admin did a file by file comparison of all the CF .jar files and found what needed to be applied.</p>
