<p>This workaround only applies to WPF applications.  Currently Silverlight does not support the x:TypeArguments property that is required in the deriving controlâ€™s XAML root tag.</p>

<p>If you must have Silverlight controls that derive from a generic base class you have to do some extra work.  Basically you need to have an extra class in the middle so that the UserControl would derive from a non-generic class</p>

<p>Base class:  public class GenericBase : UserControl</p>

<p>Middle class:  public class MiddleStringControl : GenericBase</p>

<p>UserControl:  public class UserControlWithGenericBase : MiddleStringControl </p>
