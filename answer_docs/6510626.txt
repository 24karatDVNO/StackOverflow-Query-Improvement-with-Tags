<p>My guess is you are running low of memory, not just for the application but tocache disk access.  Having more memory, regardless of your process is likely to be your problem.</p>

<p>When your system is running slow is you system waiting on IO or consming CPU. e.g. have a look on <code>top</code>.</p>

<p>BTW: I use IntelliJ CE with about 15,000 classes open and it works fine on a machine with 24 GB. ;)</p>
