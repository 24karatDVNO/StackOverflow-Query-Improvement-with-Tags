<p>If you can create an HTTP POST request using JSON, <a href="http://postageapp.com" rel="nofollow">PostageApp</a> can easily handle what you are looking for.</p>

<p>You can create the web interface that would talk with our API whenever a client wishes to send out an email, and you have an archive of recently sent messages on our backend. Now, if you're looking for just an email client to send and receive, that might be something else completely.</p>

<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>
