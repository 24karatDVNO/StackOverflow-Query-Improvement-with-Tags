<p>MVC documentation is very poor which is very strange for Microsoft's standards. The best and in my opinion the most complete reference is Steven Sanderson's <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1430228865" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Pro ASP.NET MVC 2 Framework</a>. I gave up on MSDN MVC documentation long time ago.</p>
