<p>I have started using <a href="http://velocity.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">velocity</a> lately which is pretty decent and not as invasive as some other tools. </p>

<p>However, I have started looking into <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/" rel="nofollow">PhoneGap</a> which will let you create apps for apple, android, and Microsoft devices. This may not be what you are looking for, but with it you can create apps for these devices and share the back end code. It is really useful.</p>

<p>Asa a side note, Google's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/" rel="nofollow">Guice</a> is a really good DI toolkit. Here is a comparison of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/SpringComparison" rel="nofollow">Spring and Guice</a>.</p>
