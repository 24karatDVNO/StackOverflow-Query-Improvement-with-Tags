<p>Just download and install the windows 64 bit version of MongoDB from the official website.</p>

<p>Run it normally on windows (outside of cygwin).</p>

<p>You will still be able to connect from nodejs within cygwin.</p>

<p>The installation of mongodb will also come with the shell application so you can run mongodb commands directly to the database.</p>
