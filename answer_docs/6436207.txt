<p>If I put the log.xml file in my project directory, the logger library will write in the</p>

<pre><code>project/bin/debug/log.xml
</code></pre>

<p>while the xaml binding will look for log.xml in</p>

<pre><code>project/log.xml
</code></pre>

<p>I solved the problem setting the property of the log.xml file to "Content" not to "Resource"..even if I really don't know the difference :)</p>
