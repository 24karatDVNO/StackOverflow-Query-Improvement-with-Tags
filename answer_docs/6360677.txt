<p>realize that <code>c.getString(0)</code> means that you are requesting the 0 column index on the record currently being pointed to by the Cursor object.  if you are not using managedQuery, i suggest you call <code>c.moveToFirst()</code> before attempting to pull data.  then explicity request the column index you want with <code>c.getString(c.getColumnIndex("nameofcolumn"));</code>.  note, of course, that "nameofcolumn" must have been requested in the query.</p>
