<p>Using <code>list-style-position:outside;</code> specifically for IE6/IE7 worked for me. However, note that this may only be necessary if you're using <code>list-style-position:inside;</code> for other browsers and simply hiding the default list margin/padding by setting them to 0. Working with IE requires some finesse, and a lot of browser-specific CSS.</p>
