<p>I found an <a href="http://blog.xam.de/2008/07/towards-gajs-un-obfuscated.html" rel="nofollow">unobfuscated version of ga.js</a>. The tracking information is sent to Google using an image object that is not added to the DOM. A handler is added to the image's onload event. Based on this, I don't believe that calling push will block my code (at least not for long), and whatever it is doing in onload will be asynchronous. This means that navigating away from the page can possibly prevent some of my analytics tracking from being logged. If anyone can confirm these things, I will mark your answer as correct.</p>
