<p>These surely are some very interesting findings. But I suspect if the JVM has optimized the loops. It would be interesting to see if the code got expanded. (Loop expansion was once a optimization technique when C was still popular and every CPU clock counts)</p>

<p>e.g</p>

<pre><code>final int cycles = maxCycles / 100
for (x=0;x&lt;cycles;x++){
    fTest = 6666f;
    fTest = 6666f;
... 100 times ...
    fTest = 6666f;
    fTest = 6666f;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if possible, make them even 1000 times... and even one step further: write a program to generate the source code which makes every line has a unique number to rule out any possible optimization by the JVM.</p>
