<p>On iOS 5 you can directly access a UIWebView's scroll view, which is where you really want to add your button, <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwebview/1617955-scrollview" rel="nofollow noreferrer">https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiwebview/1617955-scrollview</a>. But I tend to agree with the previous commenters, you should probably be considering a different approach as mixing UIKit with a web view isn't really meant to work how you describe.</p>
