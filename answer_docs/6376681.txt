<p>From <a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/html-spec_8.html#SEC8.1.2.5" rel="nofollow">w3 specs</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An INPUT element with <code>TYPE=IMAGE'
  specifies an image resource to
  display, and allows input of two form
  fields: the x and y coordinate of a
  pixel chosen from the image. The names
  of the fields are the name of the
  field with</code>.x' and <code>.y' appended.
  </code>TYPE=IMAGE' implies `TYPE=SUBMIT'
  processing; that is, when a pixel is
  chosen, the form as a whole is
  submitted.</p>

<p>Perhaps working fine in IE in your case, but not as intended.</p>
