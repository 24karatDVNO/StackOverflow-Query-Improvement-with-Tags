<p>I assume that you have declared a member function (usually in a <code>.h</code> or <code>.hpp</code> file) but have ommited the respective definition of the member function (usually in a <code>.cpp</code> file).</p>

<p>In c++, it is possible to declare a class like so: </p>

<pre><code>class foo {
  void x();
  void y();
}
</code></pre>

<p>with a cpp file that goes like so</p>

<pre><code>void foo::x() {
   do_something()
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note, there is no <code>foo::y()</code>.</p>

<p>This poses no problem to the compiling/linking process as long as the member function <code>foo::y()</code> is referenced nowhere throughout the compiled code.</p>
