<p>I don't know if you know programming, but, I'll assume you don't.</p>

<p>Basically, to make a GUI (graphical user interface) application for Windows, you must use the Win32 API or something built "on top" (i.e. abstracts from) of it.</p>

<p>You can do this with C++ directly or with .NET (a thing that makes life easier for you).</p>

<p>For .NET, you can use multiple languages, such as Visual Basic and C#, I recommend you start with C# and then go from there.</p>
