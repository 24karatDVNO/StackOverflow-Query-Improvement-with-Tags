<p>Are you part of a domain and the SMTP server is also on this domain. If this is the case, it could be that you are being authenticated by Windows authentication automatically and the user that IIS is running under is probably local to the machine it is on. You could either run the app pool under a domain user and use impersonation (not tested, but should work) or add some credentials to the SMTP server programatically when sending the email.</p>
