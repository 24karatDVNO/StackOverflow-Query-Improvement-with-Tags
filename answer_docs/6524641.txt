<p>Using <code>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</code> will only delete the associated object when the object itself is destroyed. You aren't destroying the user record, just changing one of its attributes, so this functionality is never triggered. </p>

<p>To destroy it yourself, do something like</p>

<pre><code>user = User.first
user.account.destroy
user.account = Admin.create
user.save
</code></pre>
