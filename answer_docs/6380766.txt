<p>Ruby support is only available (and at that, only partially) in Titanium desktop apps - there's no Ruby support for mobile applications right now.</p>

<p>All coding in Titanium mobile is done using javascript, which as you can imagine, has certain upsides and downsides.  For example, to make my apps, I had to implement a class system on top of the class-less javascript language, build an ActiveRecord-like database abstraction layer over the sqlite database, etc. to get to the type of facilities I'm used to using in my Ruby/Rails projects.  But it's all still in javascript.</p>

<p>That said, javascript is quite Ruby-like in many ways, and is much preferable (to me at least) than using either Java syntax or Objective C syntax for coding, even with the basic support provided.  But if you don't have a mastery of javascript (in particular closures and functional scoping) you will need to read up to use Titanium.</p>
