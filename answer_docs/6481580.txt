<p>You could create a quad for each axis' plane. Texture the quad with a grid textur that is transparent between the grid lines. By making the center grid lines bold and positioning the quad just right, you can get all 3 grids (if you want more than one) to line up perfectly at the world origin.</p>

<p>It can be heavy for the pixel shader in that every pixel on the screen will be involved, but if it is just for developmment only, you'll be OK.</p>
