<p>Khushboo, it used to happen with me many times. The reason behind that was I was missing some closing tag somewhere in my aspx page. I used to copy my whole aspx page to some other text editor and paste all the elements one by one to my aspx page. It always solved my this problem. I am sure you must be missing some closing tag, please cross check all elements. </p>
