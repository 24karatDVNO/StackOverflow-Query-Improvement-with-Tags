<p>There will be a problem with using mouseover: if the larger image appears on mouseover in a fixed location, it would be nearly impossible to ensure that it does not cover the location of the thumbnail; and when it does your cursor is no longer over the thumbnail (rather it's over the larger image). and the image would automatically hide again.</p>

<p>So if you want a fixed position for the larger image, I'd recommend using/writing another script that opens the image on click, with a "close image" -type link. Lightbox scripts are typically how this is done. </p>

<p><strong>The original lightbox</strong>:<br>
<a href="http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox2/" rel="nofollow">Lighbox 2</a>  -- by Lokesh Dhakar "...a simple, unobtrusive script used to overlay images on the current page. It's a snap to setup and works on all modern browsers."  (I beleive this is the 2nd version of the 'origal' lightbox script)</p>

<p><strong>My recommendation</strong> (the one I use -- lighter, more standards compliant):<br>
<a href="http://www.digitalia.be/software/slimbox2" rel="nofollow">Slimbox 2</a> -- by Christophe Beyl "...is a 4 KB visual clone of the popular Lightbox 2 script by Lokesh Dhakar, written using the jQuery javascript library. It was designed to be very small, efficient, standards-friendly, fully customizable, more convenient and 100% compatible with the original Lightbox 2."</p>
