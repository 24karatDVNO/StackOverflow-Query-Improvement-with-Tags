<p>First of all, don't check with isset. Since $_POST is always generated you should be using !empty().</p>

<p>Remove @'s before mysql_* commands, this makes your script slow and suppresses helpful errors.</p>

<p>And you are having issues because you don't have table variable set, $table_name needs to be defined.</p>

<p>If you are inserting questions to a table named 'questions' simply change your SQL to:</p>

<pre><code>//Insert data into database
$sql = "INSERT INTO `questions` (name, question)
             VALUES ('$name', '$question')";
</code></pre>
