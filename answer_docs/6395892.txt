<p>In Subversion does not exist a definition like a "Project"...the definition must be done by you. This means Subversion executes that on the change in the repository not on the "Project" base...</p>

<p>You can use the information you get like the repository and the revision number to extract the information you need...You can do that simply by using svnlook to extract the information you need..by calling svnlook with the appropriate parameters.</p>
