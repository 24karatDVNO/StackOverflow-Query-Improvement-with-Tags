<p>The problem is the size of your view : it's too big.
If you built the view using the interface builder, you have to set the <em>top bar</em> property of your <code>UIView</code> to <em>Navigation Bar</em> in the properties panel. This should automatically resize your view. Make sure your map view is resized as well.</p>
