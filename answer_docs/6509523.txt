<p>Depending on the OS, it might be a problem of sessions. If you take another look at documentation for CreateEvent, CreateMemoryMapping etc., you will notice GLOBAL\ prefix to object name. This prefix (among with SESSION\x\ prefix) define visibility scope of the object. GLOBAL prefixes are seen across the whole system, while objects without prefix in the name are local to specific (current if the \SESSION prefix is omitted) session. Sessions appeared in Terminal Services for Windows XP, then got themselves into the OS in Windows 2003 Server and later.</p>
