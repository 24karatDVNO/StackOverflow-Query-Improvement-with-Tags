<p>I try to avoid break and continue when dealing with loops because they are easy to miss and their meanings change if you have to restructure the code later.  You can use j=5; when you need to exit the inner loop.  If you add a third loop or a switch the meaning of that line doesn't change.  Sometimes you will need to add if statements inside your loops testing i and j or even a new variable like bool iIsInvalid but I think that makes the control flow easier to read.</p>
