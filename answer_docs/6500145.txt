<p>Without much code, it's hard to tell what exactly the problem will be. That said, there's numerous common causes of slow performance:</p>

<ul>
<li>DOM goes too deep</li>
<li>Not destroying panels after you're finished with them</li>
<li>Using intensive animations on older/slower phones</li>
<li>autoLoading all your data on app initialization, rather than lazy-loading them when the appropriate panel opens</li>
</ul>

<p>I'd highly recommend if you haven't checked it out already, <a href="http://www.senchatouchbits.com/10/performance-optimization.html" rel="nofollow">to watch this video on Sencha Touch optimization</a>. There's a slideshare out there of it too, though less detailed. This is just the beginning though -- mobile devices have less memory and CPU power so elegant and efficient code is the best medicine. I would follow up watching that video with reading up about <a href="http://myxaab.wordpress.com/2011/02/27/sencha-touch-mvc-application-part-2/" rel="nofollow">building your app in an MVC architecture</a>. </p>
