<p>maybe not THE most efficient, but you could try this:</p>

<pre><code>int main() {
    //use ifstream to read
    ifstream in("yourfile.txt");

    //string to store the line
    string line = "";

    //random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 100000; i++) {
        in.seekg(rand() % 10000);
        in&gt;&gt;line;
        //do what you want with the line here...
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Im too lazy right now, but you need to make sure that you check your ifstream for errors like end-of-file, index-out-of-bounds, etc...</p>
