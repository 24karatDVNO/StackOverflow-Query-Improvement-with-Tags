<p>You have no variable declared <code>s1</code>. You merely added a control to the form having that name. You can retrieve it using:</p>

<pre><code>Dim s1 As Object
s1 = Controls("s1")
</code></pre>

<p>My VB6 is rusty though so Iâ€™m not sure that, this being an <code>Object</code>, you can meaningfully work with it yet.</p>
