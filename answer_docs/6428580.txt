<p>First, I'd lose the old outer join syntax and rewrite using ANSI (that might get rid of your error message right off the bat - it's a shortcoming of the old (+) syntax). I'd then try to incorporate CASE logic in the where clause (untested):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT info.sortingorder sort, info.stage, SUM(am.qty) boh
FROM it.snapshot am
   , it.info info LEFT JOIN it.naming nm ON info.stage = nm.stage
WHERE CASE WHEN 
           (:flag = 1 AND am.process IN 
              (SELECT process_name FROM it.special_processes)) THEN 'Y'
           WHEN 
           (:flag = 2 AND am.process NOT IN 
              (SELECT process_name FROM it.special_processes)) THEN 'Y'
           WHEN :flag = 0 THEN 'Y'
           ELSE 'N'
      end = 'Y'
GROUP BY info.sortingorder, info.stage;
</code></pre>
