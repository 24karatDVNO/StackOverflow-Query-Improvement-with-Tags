<p>Like mikera commented it is hard to say which one is better, if the answering person has used only a few of them, not all. If you have some time and good will and you really want to know which is the best, I could suggest the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Check which technology has fanciest plugin to your favorite IDE. You'll see that already by searching little bit for tutorials for every one of them. I know that at least Vaadin has a GUI for Eclipse and I think many others also do have one.</p></li>
<li><p>Why not consider a content management system? A good one is Liferay, for example. There you have tools for creating the content by ready tools and even the site can be managed by its own tools.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are some general tips for the area, that may be usefull also for others :)</p>
