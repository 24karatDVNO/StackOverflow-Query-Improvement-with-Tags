<p>SlimDX is a relatively low-level library. It lets you have access to the full power of DirectX, and you can target old legacy hardware as well as the new top-end stuff. This also means that it's difficult to get things set up, and you need a lot more code to draw simple things like sprites and text. </p>

<p>If you're looking strictly from a usability standpoint, SDL is probably a better bet for you.</p>
