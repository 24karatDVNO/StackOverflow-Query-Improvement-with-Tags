<p>I have had the error. 
My solution was very simple. I've just check the app id and the other keys and I notice that they were bad. I have copied directly thes ones of the examples and this is why it didn't work.
Please, do just check again all the keys and be sure that they are ok.
I have used sdk 3.0.1, the last one it the time of writing this.</p>
