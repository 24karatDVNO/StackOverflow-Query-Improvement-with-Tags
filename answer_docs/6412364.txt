<p>You are almost there, if url.OpenStream() throws an exception you would catch it. But to be completely on the safe side, you need to put </p>

<pre><code>xr.parse(is); 
</code></pre>

<p>before</p>

<pre><code>hb.exequteSql("Delete...");
</code></pre>

<p>Because xr.parse could throw an IO or SAX exception, and your code would delete even if that happens.</p>

<p>for API, please see</p>

<p>Also i would recommend you catch, IO and SAX exceptions seperately. It would help you debug things easily.</p>
