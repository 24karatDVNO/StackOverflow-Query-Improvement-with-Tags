<p>It is probably too much of a generalization to say that an ORM is the root cause of poor performance on any web site that uses it; performance is more complex than that.  If you are using a relational database, the best approach is probably to start out using an ORM, then if performance is not good enough, use a profiler to find the real bottlenecks and address them.  You may end up using an ORM in some places and hand-tuned SQL in others.</p>
