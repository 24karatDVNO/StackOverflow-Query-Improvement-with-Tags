<p>Please include the code part where you call this function (setting up the event handler), it's hard to find the problem without that. You have some strange selectors but they might be correct, depending on your HTML.</p>

<p><em>Note that since jQuery 1.6, using <a href="http://api.jquery.com/prop/" rel="nofollow">prop()</a> is recommended instead of <code>attr()</code> when editing properties like <code>checked</code>.</em></p>
