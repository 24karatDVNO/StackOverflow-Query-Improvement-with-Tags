<p>Liav what you are looking for is Sikuli at sikuli.org its fully visual testing..it has its own IDE but you can still do the code in Eclipse..but its the same as monekyrunner in that certain stuff you can do as visual ie recording of device users actions but that you have to write code to get rest of the way.</p>
