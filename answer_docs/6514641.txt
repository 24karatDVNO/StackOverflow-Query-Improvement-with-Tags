<p>The file name should be (according to convention) <code>pick.js.erb</code> and not <code>pick.html.erb</code> based on the fact that you have JavaScript code included.</p>

<p>If you want to include a partial inside this one, you can use the <code>escape_javascript</code> helper to render the partial.</p>

<p>If you have more than one possible file to be rendered from the <code>pick</code> action, you should look into using <code>respond_to</code> such as:</p>

<pre><code>@route = Route.find(params[:id])
respond_to do |format|
  format.html
  format.js { render :js =&gt; @route }
end
</code></pre>
