<p>Similar to @tjg184 's experience. I would recommend running a tomcat per application instance. If you have a decent config and process management system, the incremental cost is not all that high and it gives you the best isolation possible without separate vm's for each tomcat instance. You could start with a single tomcat and some solid monitoring and then see if you need to move to one tomcat per app.</p>
