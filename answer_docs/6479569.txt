<p>If you are using HTTP as your socket/server protocol then you may want to check out a new application called Maque. It's designed to help test and develop HTTP and data driven applications. It has a built in HTTP 1.1 server and provides a UI to allow you to create your API and test requests without having to code or deploy a server stack.</p>

<p>If you are running automated tests like Paul, then you may face some of same challenges of starting the app up and then running the app then shutting it down, but for development and regular testing it should handle what you are looking for.</p>

<p>You can get the cross-platform (OS X, Windows, Linux) beta here: <a href="http://maqueapp.com/getBeta.html" rel="nofollow">http://maqueapp.com/getBeta.html</a></p>
