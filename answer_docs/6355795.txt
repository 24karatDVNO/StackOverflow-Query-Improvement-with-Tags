<p>As suggested by an earlier post you can use the Cookpie plugin for Firefox to have two separate identities in each browser tab - but that extension doesn't work with firefox 4 - (they say they're working on it....) However there's a newer similar extension called Multifox which does work in Firefox 4. You could try that.</p>
