<p>I don't know about the internals of your <code>SComms</code> object there, but it doesn't look like you're doing anything to create more than one record.  You're just setting one object's <code>ListID</code> property over and over again.</p>

<p>If <code>SComms</code> is a regular class and you want to return a collection of them, you might do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[WebMethod]  
public static SComms comms()  
{  
  var result = new List&lt;SComms&gt;();   

  string connect = System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnectionString"].ConnectionString;  
  string query = "select * from dbo.Comms where dateadd(dd, datediff(dd, 0, created), 0) = dateadd(dd, datediff(dd, +10, getdate()), 0) order by 2";  

  using (SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection(connect))  
  {  
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(query, conn))  
    {            
      conn.Open();  
      SqlDataReader rdr = cmd.ExecuteReader();  

      // No need to test for HasRows first. If there aren't any,
      //  the while won't execute and the method will return
      //  an empty array which is easy to test for on the client-side.
      while (rdr.Read())  
      {  
        var c = new SComms();

        c.ListID = rdr["ListID"].ToString();
        c.Title = rdr["Title"].ToString();

        result.Add(c);
      }  
    }  
  }

  return result;  
}  
</code></pre>
