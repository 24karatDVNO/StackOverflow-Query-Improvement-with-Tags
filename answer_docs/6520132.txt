<p>You can use any SDK that comes with pre-compiled binaries using the WinAPI functions <strong>LoadLibraryA</strong> and <strong>GetProcAddress</strong>. Or you can build your own import libraries for MASM by following what either <a href="http://win32assembly.online.fr/importlib.html" rel="nofollow">Iczelion did write on that topic</a> (definately worth a read) or by reading the <a href="http://www.sascha-hennig.de/masm/using-the-fmod-api-with-masm-part-13" rel="nofollow">3 part guide</a> on my website, which is based on Iczelions guide but works on a live example, namely creating your own MASM import library for the FMOD API.</p>

<p>Weather it is worth all the hassle is another question.</p>
