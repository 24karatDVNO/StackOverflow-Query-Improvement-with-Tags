<p>yes there is a way actually, first you need to make apache tomcat log using log4j instead of the default logger. 
Then you can actually customize the output for log4j. You are going to have to read a bit on logging for tomcat, and about log4j, you can have console output configured and then you can have what ever colors you need in them since they are customizable. </p>
