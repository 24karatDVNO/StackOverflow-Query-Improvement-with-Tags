<p>Just a side note, but if you do wish to use the SDK you can work around the local issue by editing your hosts file and adding localhost.local for 127.0.0.1. /etc/hosts on a linux machine and C:\WINDOWS\system32\drivers\etc\hosts on a windows machine.</p>

<p>Then in the Facebook app settings, simply set localhost.local as your domain and set your site url accordingly. </p>

<p>You should be ready to go then.</p>
