<p>This code is valid, but it will not do what you want</p>

<pre><code>if (url==showbasket.html||order1.html
</code></pre>

<p>"url==showbasket.html" checks if "url" is equal to the "html" attribute of object "showbasket". Since showbasket does not exist, your code will throw an exception. </p>

<p>"||order1.html" means the same, check if the "html" attribute of "order1" object is "true"</p>

<p>Like others have said, what you want to do is :</p>

<pre><code>if ( url == "showbasket.html" || url == "order1.html"
</code></pre>
