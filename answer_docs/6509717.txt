<p>You can't reference the updated table <code>c</code> within a sub-subquery (factored or otherwise). You'll have to eliminate it, maybe something like this (untested):</p>

<pre><code>update calc c set price = (
    select sum(t.units) * avg(other_prc)
    from trans t, products p
    where t.trans_date between c.start_date and c.end_date
      and t.trans_date between p.prod_start and p.prod_end
      and t.prod_id = p.prod_id
      and t.agrmt_id=c.agrmt_id
      and t.cust_num=c.cust_num
)
</code></pre>
