<p><strong>Got the bugger!</strong></p>

<p>I was using <code>MemoryCache</code> to cache some results and realized that I was using that cache to request an <code>EntityKey</code>.</p>

<p><strong>My advise</strong>: Please check if in your project you really want to deal with all this workarounds!</p>
