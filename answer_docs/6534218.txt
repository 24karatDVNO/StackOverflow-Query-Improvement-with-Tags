<p>Try using the following syntax to get all the cells that contains values in the sheet regardless of the auto-filter on/off or the actual filter used.</p>

<p>I think this is what you're looking for:</p>

<pre><code>Worksheet currSheet = excelApp.ActiveWorkbook.ActiveSheet;
object[,] objData = (object[,])currSheet.UsedRange.Value2;
</code></pre>

<p>the <code>Value2</code> member holds the underline content of the cell/Range. if you're looking for the visible string displayed to the user, use <code>Text</code> property.</p>
