<p>Of course you can. The only specific feature which you use is "flock" and thats available also in php (see <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.flock.php" rel="nofollow">flock doc</a>).</p>

<p>The other steps are pretty similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>replace "my" with "$"</li>
<li>init block with a while(1) loop </li>
<li>die with exit </li>
<li>and the if cases to php representation</li>
</ul>
