<p>I would say Google chrome is the best browser till date.... and its an ideal browser for sencha touch applications to run, since it contains webkit..</p>

<p>Also you can use Titanium (<a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/download/" rel="nofollow">you can download it here</a>) which has iphone/iPad simulater built in but for that you need a Mac and you also have to download ios sdk.
Working on these simulators is an awesome experience.</p>
