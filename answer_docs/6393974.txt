<p>There are a lot of ways to handle more difficult merging paths.  You can exclude certain files from a merge of course but to answer this question directly: you will have to merge them everytime.</p>

<p>Take a proj file for instance.  If you add a reference, that reference will need to make its way to the main branch somehow.  Sure, sometimes developers download SPs which can force a proj file to get revved and you don't want that getting pushed up to main but it comes down to the person doing the merge to be smart enough to catch these things and also to the developer to be aware of what they are attempting to merge up.</p>

<p>Merging is difficult and will always be difficult :/</p>
