From what it appears it seems that you'll need to use AppleScript to create addins but you must be familiar with the Office Object Model. Support for addins is supposedly coming to v2011.</p>

<p>My apologies if this information isn't helpful. Documentation for Mac addins is sketchy as I'm sure you're aware.</p>
