<p>It's not straightforward using the <a href="http://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/nodes/Element.html" rel="nofollow">Element</a> class unfortunately. The reason being that the 'text()' method within class Element, "Gets the combined text of this element and all its children". This is really irritating as you can't just get the text of a single element. You will need to use the <code>Elements.select(String).text()</code> method from the <a href="http://jsoup.org/apidocs/org/jsoup/select/Elements.html" rel="nofollow">Elements</a> class and perhaps use a wildcard (if possible). This method will return the 'combined' text of all matching nodes. This is returned as a single string so you can then call String's '<code>length()</code>' method on it.</p>
