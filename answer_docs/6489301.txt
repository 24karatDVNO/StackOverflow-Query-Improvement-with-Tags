<p>What i feel, is that the code conventions are for formatting the code, so that if some other guy reads that, there is no such problem in understanding the code,</p>

<p>Untill, you are writing the code in such a way, that any one can understand the code, just by a look into it, then its fine not to use tha Java Code Conventions.</p>
