<p>Despite the .NET 4.0 CAS changes, CAS permission demands are still pertinent, but mainly for API/framework developers, which was pretty much their intended user even way back when.  Unfortunately, the docs (including the exam prep materials) don't make a very clear distinction between CAS stuff that is relevant to API devs vs application devs.  Most application devs should never (or at least very, very rarely) need to write a permission demand other than for a PrincipalPermission (which isn't really a CAS permission) in any version of the .NET Framework.</p>
