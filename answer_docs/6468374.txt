<p>well assuming you have the two closing divs in your html structure, my guess is that it is a float problem. put this before the closing div for #footer and you should be alright:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div style='clear:both'>&lt;/div></code></pre>

<p>also add</p>

<pre><code>#footer{
    clear:both;
}</code></pre>
