<p>Something like this should do it. You're basically adding blocks of 30 mins to a time and looping till you get the correct number of options. </p>

<pre><code>//get the timestamp for 6.30 am
$time   = strtotime('6.30 am'); //not important what the date is.

//start adding 30mins
$times      = array();
$halfHour   = 60 * 30;
$blocks     = 12; //adjust this to get the number of options
while ($blocks) {
    $times[]  = date('h:i', $time) . ' - ' . date('h:i a', ($time += $halfHour)); //I keep incrementing the time by half an hour
    $blocks--;
}
var_dump($times);
</code></pre>
