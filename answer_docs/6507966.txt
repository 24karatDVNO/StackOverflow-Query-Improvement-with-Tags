<p>Sounds like a perfect application for javascript. Specifically, I would use jQuery with the Form Plugin. You make your form as usual, then include some JS scripts on your page, copy/paste a few lines of jQuery code from their examples, and you're good to go.</p>

<p>You'll have to figure the rest out yourself, but you will have the full text of the XML page in your javascript "success" function so you can do whatever you want from there.</p>
