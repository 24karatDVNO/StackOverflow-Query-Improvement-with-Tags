<p>In C++, int means it is signed. So, when you call with an unsigned int, it sees that there is no matching function call, and it tries to type promote unsigned int to something for which a match may occur, but here, it is unable to decide to which data type it must promote itself since unsigned int can be promoted to both int and float. (I'm not sure about that "Unsigned float")</p>
