<p>Answered my own question.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://intsys.mgt.qub.ac.uk/notes/perceptr.html" rel="nofollow">http://intsys.mgt.qub.ac.uk/notes/perceptr.html</a>, "add this correction to any weight for which there was an input". In other words, do not add the correction to weights whose neurons had a value of 0.</p>
