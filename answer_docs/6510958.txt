<p>I've encountered this problem myself, that a page with validation errors can still continue on to submission when the user clicks the submit button.</p>

<p>What you can do is something like this :</p>

<pre><code>    protected void submitClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        if (!Page.IsValid)
        {
           // somehow the user was able to submit their form even though there are
           // validation errors. Stop here and let ASP.NET present the error messages
           // to the user
           return; 
        }

        // do submission stuff here like putting things in the database
    }
</code></pre>
