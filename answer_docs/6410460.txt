<p>Every good DBMS should provide (too long) query logging feature.</p>

<p>But if you want to stay with Java try using <a href="http://jdbclogger.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">JDBC Logger</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/log4jdbc/" rel="nofollow">Log4JDBC</a>.
Remember that full query logging may hit performance of your application, so do it in production carefully.</p>
