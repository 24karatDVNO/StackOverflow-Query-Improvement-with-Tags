<p>I faced the same issue and wasted 2 days on it. In my case an upgrade to XCode caused it. I downgraded XCode to the previous version and it got fixed for me. If this is your issue then uninstall new version, reboot and then install old version again. That should do it for you.</p>

<p>I have also added some screenshots and info to my blog about this issue here: <a href="http://iostipsntricks.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/solved-application-executable-is-missing-a-required-architecture-at-least-one-of-the-following-architectures-must-be-present-armv6/" rel="nofollow">http://iostipsntricks.wordpress.com/2011/06/24/solved-application-executable-is-missing-a-required-architecture-at-least-one-of-the-following-architectures-must-be-present-armv6/</a></p>
