<p>This is the workflow that I came up with, and so far I think its working well.</p>

<p>The user is required to authenticate to the website via third party OpenID/Facebook/etc (mobile friendly website is available). Then, in their "profile" they can generate an API "key" which they can copy/paste into their client software. It isn't 100% transparent to the user, but its pretty good.</p>
