<p>The procedure which updates the jobclosed table runs Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, &amp; Friday mornings.  It doesn't run on Saturdays, so the records aren't inserted until monday, at which time they won't be retrieved by my stored procedure.  I will schedule the update job to run on Saturday's also.</p>

<p>I added the following before the select statement:</p>

<pre><code>if datepart(dw, GETDATE()) = 7 OR datepart(dw, GETDATE()) = 1
    BEGIN
        Exec dbo.NCL_MaintainJobClosedDateTable
        --Select 'True'
    END
</code></pre>

<p>Which will force an update on Saturday and Sunday mornings.</p>
