<p>I'm not an expert with this but I have a similar situation</p>

<p>for my situation is that I have one domain but with 3 sub-domain</p>

<p>so what happen is that each of the sub-domain contain the sitemap.xml</p>

<p>but since my case was different directory for each of the sub-domain</p>

<p>but I'm pretty sure that the sitemap.xml can be specify for which of each domain.</p>
