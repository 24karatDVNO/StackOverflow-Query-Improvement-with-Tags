<p>The simplest way is to get the precompiled binaries maintained by Komodo from <a href="http://code.activestate.com/komodo/remotedebugging/" rel="nofollow">here</a> (choose the most recent 'PHP Remote Debugging Client' package), then unzip it, find the folder that corresponds to your version of PHP e.g. 5.3 and copy the xdebug.so file from there into your php extensions folder.</p>

<p>Then adjust php.ini as outlined in the other posts.</p>
