<p>We are having the same problem with a .com domain. It only seems to happen when you have domain and hosting in the old provider together in the same pack and when trasferring the domain the hosting is also turned down along with all DNS records. Not all providers behave that way.</p>

<p>I would get a new hosting and change DNS in the whois before ordering the domain transfer, being sure that the new hosting is working.</p>

<p>In our case the old registrar didn't allow us change the whois, so we took the chance and it failed. Once the mess is done, I suppose we can only wait.</p>
