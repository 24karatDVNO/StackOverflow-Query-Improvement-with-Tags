<p>Another shot-in-the-dark reply:</p>

<p>Try changing the class you're inheriting ( <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173149(v=VS.80).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173149(v=VS.80).aspx</a> ) from SequenceActivity to Activity (SequenceActivity inherits from CompositeActivity, which itself inherits from Activity. See: <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.workflow.activities.sequenceactivity(v=VS.90).aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.workflow.activities.sequenceactivity(v=VS.90).aspx</a> )</p>

<p>If that doesn't work, try removing your constructor entirely. You should be able to use the base (Sequence)Activity constructor (since you're inheriting the class, not implementing it)</p>

<p>Hope that helps...</p>
