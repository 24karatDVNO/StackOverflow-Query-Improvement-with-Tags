<p>I guess there is easier way to implement the above requirement. All I was trying to do was create an editorpart that would show only the title box so that people can only update the title of the webpart being edited. I figured out that the best alternative is, is to use PropertyGridEditorPart. This webpart is ideal in situation where you want to allow user to set customized property for a webpart. Here is documentation from microsoft website:</p>

<p>In my case i created following property and webpart framework took care of rest!!!!</p>

<pre><code>[Personalizable(PersonalizationScope.User),
WebBrowsable,
WebDisplayName("Web part Title"),
WebDescription("Description of property.")]
public string WebPartTitle
{
  get { return this.Title; }
  set { this.Title = value; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks</p>
