<p>You can always use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-class.php" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>get_class()</code></a>, but the name is not going to change simply by creating two or more instances of the object. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6375738/get-the-name-of-the-object-calling-one-of-its-methods/6375763#6375763">Neal's solution</a> will work but it doesn't actually change the name of the class, and begs the question: Why do you need it?</p>
