<p>Ok, I solved it by creating a new solution and just copying all the projects from the original to the new solution. The socket is now working as expected.
Very weird. Only difference is that I have less references in my new solution (didn't add the unused references in the new solution). Could references influence socket behaviour? Or are there hidden solution settings? </p>
