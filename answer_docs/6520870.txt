<p>If I understand you want to assert that a property of some objects in a list isn't equals at something....
if you can user the commons collection ( <a href="http://commons.apache.org/collections/" rel="nofollow">http://commons.apache.org/collections/</a> ) you can use the interface <strong>org.apache.commons.collections.Predicate</strong> to search in a list (using the method <em>org.apache.commons.collections.CollectionUtils.find(List, Predicate)</em></p>

<p>you can make somenthing like</p>

<pre>
Predicate p = new Predicate(){
    /*
     * Test if the object has the value that you don't want
     */
    public boolean evaluate(java.lang.Object object){
         YourObject yo = (YourObject) object;
         return yo.getProperty().equals(theValue);
    }
}
//if is return null means that nothing was found
assertNull(CollectionUtils.find(yourList, p));
</pre>
