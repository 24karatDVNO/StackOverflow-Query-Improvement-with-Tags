<p>The condition should probably detect if there is any process sleeping (blocked) in the queue. However, I think these conditions are not correct, considering behaviour of a binary semaphore (semaphore initially with s == 1) the pseudocode should be</p>

<pre><code>wait(Semaphore s){ 
  s=s-1;
  if (s&lt;0) {
    // add process to queue
    block();
  }
}

signal(Semaphore s){
  s=s+1;
  if (s&lt;=0) {
    // remove process p from queue
    wakeup(p);
  }
}
</code></pre>
