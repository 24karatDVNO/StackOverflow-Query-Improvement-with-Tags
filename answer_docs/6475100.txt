<p>From reading the query, it looks like you want call Categories, and for each category, you want a count of Krits (approved) for the respective categories, and when there are none, you still want the Category, but show the count of 0...</p>

<p>Try this</p>

<pre><code>select
      cat.*,
      COALESCE( kc.KritCount, 0 ) as KritCount
   from 
      Categories cat
         left join ( select k.CategoryID, 
                            count(*) KritCount
                        from 
                           Krits k
                        where
                           k.approved = '1'
                        group by 
                           k.CategoryID ) kc
            on cat.id = kc.CategoryID
</code></pre>
