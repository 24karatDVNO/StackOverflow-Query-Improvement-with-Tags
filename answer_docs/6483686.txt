<p>There are various ways to do this. Just adding more options:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM double_select AS d
WHERE EXISTS  
    ( SELECT * 
      FROM double_select AS dd
      WHERE dd.status = 'ready' 
        AND dd.orderID = d.orderID 
    )

SELECT d.* 
FROM double_select AS d
  JOIN
    ( SELECT DISTINCT orderID 
      FROM double_select 
      WHERE status = 'ready'
    ) AS ds
    ON ds.orderID = d.orderID  

SELECT a.*
FROM double_select AS a 
  JOIN double_select AS b
    ON a.orderId = b.orderId
WHERE b.status = 'ready'
GROUP BY a.itemId
</code></pre>
