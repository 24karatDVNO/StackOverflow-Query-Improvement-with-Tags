<p>Sadly there is no way to create MovieClip animations at runtime, they can only be created using Flash Authoring (or possibly other tools that can export to swf).</p>

<p>Your options are to either create a bunch of <code>Sprite</code> or possibly <code>Shape</code> and add/remove these from the display list as you progress throught the frames. Another option, if your graphics are simpler, you can generate them on the fly for each frame. </p>
