<p>I just tried same configurations 
jar got downloaded from following location which is one of default repos </p>

<p><a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/httpcomponents/httpcomponents-client/4.1" rel="nofollow">http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/httpcomponents/httpcomponents-client/4.1</a></p>

<p>Just try after mentioning <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2" rel="nofollow">http://repo1.maven.org/maven2</a> explicitly in your pom file 
and try using command line </p>

<p>and apache http client 4.1.1 version is also available now </p>
