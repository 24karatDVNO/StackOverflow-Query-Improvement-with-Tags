<p>Assuming you set the handler with a simple property called onConnectionChange, you can write a new function that takes a callback instead.</p>

<pre><code>// The new function, it takes a callback to let you know
// that disconnecting is done
pluginObject.disconnect = function (deviceKey, callback) {
     var me = this;
     me.onConnectionChange = function (connectionState) {
        if (connectionState === state.disconnected) {
             delete me.onConnectionChange;
             callback();
        }
}

// Now you can call
pluginObject.disconnect(deviceKey, function() {
    pluginObject.connectDevice(deviceKey, backingInfo);
});
</code></pre>
