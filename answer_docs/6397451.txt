<p>for the fn you have given since its dividing by 4 the length is four and since there is no value added to it 0 is actually the start of the cycle and not 1.you can actually observe this if you do implement it using a graph as has been pointed out.
Since these are fn values you could use a linked list instead, and on every value the fn returns, add it to the list if its not already there, else u can have a cycle.assuming that there is only 1 cycle..</p>
