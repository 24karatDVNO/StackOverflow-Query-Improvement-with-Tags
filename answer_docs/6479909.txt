<p>Pure OO people would say you should create an abstract base class containing common operations and fields, and then for the specialisations, create sub classes.  Case statements and if statements like you have above are not pure OO.</p>

<p>Same goes for arrays in general - in pure OO you might have them as a field in a class, but any operations performed on them would be inside a class.</p>

<p>Personally, I would say go with whatever you think will be easier to maintain, quicker to program and more obvious to other people reading the code.  I guess that doesn't really answer the question though :-)</p>
