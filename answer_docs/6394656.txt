<p>Seems like Facebook needs a lot of time to process changes in your meta tags. For instance the admin tag took a couple of hours before it showed me the error link (turning layout to "standard" shows an admin message if there's an error).</p>

<p>Strange thing is the error I guess is a false URL, but the meta+fb:like URL are good. I guess it's a little error and will be fixed soon. Too bad no one else knows anything about this issue tho.</p>
