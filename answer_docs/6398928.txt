<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/107150/asp-net-treeview-and-selecting-the-selected-node">This post</a> discusses exactly what you need I think. About handling the <code>SelectedNodeChanged</code> event and also a custom piece of code for an event that fires when the currently selected node is clicked...because then the <code>SelectedNodeChanged</code> doesn't fire (the selected node doesn't change actually). Good luck! </p>
