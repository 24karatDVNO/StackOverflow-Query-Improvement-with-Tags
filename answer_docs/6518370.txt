<p>RFC 2445 should be useful to deal witch scheduling and recurrence. Here is a java library <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-rfc-2445/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/google-rfc-2445/</a>.</p>

<p>You could store recurrence rules as a text in RRULE format, then parse it with the library to calculate the next recurrence date/time.</p>

<p>It should also be useful to change the app logic the other way around - to schedule execution at the specific calculated time, not to execute every 30 minutes trying to match the current time with recurrence patterns.</p>
