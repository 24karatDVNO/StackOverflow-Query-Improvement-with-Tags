<p>I am not sure there is any built-in regex solution for to change the case. But I think you can do it by hands by writing a new regex for every character.</p>

<p>Converting to upper case example:</p>

<pre><code>$new_string = preg_replace(
    array('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', ....),
    array('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', ....),
    $string
);
</code></pre>

<p>I think you got the point.</p>
