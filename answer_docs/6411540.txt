<p>I don't think you would like the idea of annotating all your classes with dependency annotations. This is the reason why the classes are grouped into units called modules or projects so that the import or dependency resolution of one artifact is usable across all the classes within the particular group or module.</p>

<p>However, you are likely to become a big fan of Gradle. Though it's not exactly annotations, Gradle addresses most of your concerns.</p>
