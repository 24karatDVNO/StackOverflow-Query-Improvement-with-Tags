<p>You don't need, or want to include <code>this</code> in your jQuery selector call.</p>

<p>Change your code to this:</p>

<pre><code>var CustomerId = $('#header_customerid_d').children("div").children("span").attr("title");
alert(CustomerId);
</code></pre>

<p>and it will work.</p>

<p>Or, if you want to be more concise, do as one of these other fine gentlefolk have suggested!</p>
