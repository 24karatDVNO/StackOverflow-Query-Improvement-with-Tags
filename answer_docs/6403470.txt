<p>You can use <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.move-uploaded-file.php" rel="nofollow">move_uploaded_file to upload</a>, but note that your form element will also have to have the attribute <code>enctype="multipart/form-data"</code></p>

<p>For image scaling, you can use functions from the GD library. A quick search on "php scale image" reveals many useful links on the subject.</p>

<p>Not to mention the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imagecreatefromjpeg.php" rel="nofollow">manual itself</a> has many useful example scripts, including such a one you're after.</p>

<p>It seems that you're quite new to PHP. I suggest you get to know the <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/" rel="nofollow">PHP manual</a>. Use it as your first PHP resource, then articles on the internet second. After you've exhausted all other options, come here. It appears you didn't even try to solve this or research it yourself.</p>
