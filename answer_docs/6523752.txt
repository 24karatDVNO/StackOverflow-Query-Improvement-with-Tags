<p>No; this won't be possible.  You'll have to install the AIR Runtime on the Windows machine to run an AIR app.  And I expect the AIR app won't actually run w/o running the AIR App installer.</p>

<p>You may be able to look into alternate non-AIR options to turn SWFs into EXE. <a href="http://www.multidmedia.com/software/zinc/" rel="nofollow">Zinc</a> is one such software to do that.</p>

<p>Or it is possible you can create an invisible installer.  I believe if you sign up for <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/air/runtime_distribution1.html" rel="nofollow">redistribution of the AIR Runtime</a> there is a way to make the runtime installer "invisible".  I'm not sure about the app, though.  </p>
