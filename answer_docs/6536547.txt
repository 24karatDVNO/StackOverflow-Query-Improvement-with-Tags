<p>There might be an optimized way to do this but here's one query that should get your results</p>

<pre><code>select 
  food.id, 
  food.name,
  reports.reportcount
from 
  food
inner join
  (select 
    food_id, 
    count(food_id) reportcount
    from 
      report
    group by (food_id)) as reports
on food.id=reports.food_id
</code></pre>
