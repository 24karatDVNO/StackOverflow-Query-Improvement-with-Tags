<p>Here's the messy solution I was talking about..</p>

<pre><code>select
    a.SectionID, a.SectionTitle, a.SectionLevel, a.ParentID, a.PageOrder
from
    section a
    left outer join section b on b.SectionID=a.ParentID
    left outer join section c on c.SectionID=b.ParentID
order by
    c.PageOrder, b.PageOrder, a.PageOrder
</code></pre>

<p>As I mentioned in the comment, better to do it in code.. this is only for 3 levels (you could make it more by adding another outer join and order by clause).</p>
