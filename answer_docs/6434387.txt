<p>Here's something that will help to understand it. Using your version that creates new instances of Rectangle, click outside of the Rectangle and drag around the screen. It works. Now in the xaml, set IsHitTestVisible="False" for the Rectangle. Now click inside the Rectangle and drag, and it also works. It is clear that the Rectangle can intercept some manipulation events and not forward them to the LayoutRoot, and you need to make some accommodation for this.</p>
