<p>I recommend not trying to do video in Titanium.</p>

<p>We have video working in 1.6.2. Right now we only have 2 videos playing in it.  What will play is very limited. I'm guessing it is encoding issues. Also the video opens in a new Window, we can't change the url of an existing video, and have other issues.</p>
