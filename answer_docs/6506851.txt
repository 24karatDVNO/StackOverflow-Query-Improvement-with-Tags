<p>Is this what you're looking for?</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM (

SELECT firstname
FROM firstnames
ORDER BY RAND( ) 
LIMIT 10
) AS tb1
JOIN (

SELECT lastname
FROM lastnames
ORDER BY RAND( ) 
LIMIT 10
) AS tb2 ON 1=1
</code></pre>

<p>This will give you all combinations of 10 random first names and 10 random last names. Change the limits to change how many names you want to combine.</p>
