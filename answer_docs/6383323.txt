<p>it seems that you need to find some command-line video encoder. </p>

<p>following items are the first three products I found by google:
1. E.M. Total Video Converter Command Line
2. Flash Video MX SDK V2
3. Sothink Video Encoder Engine</p>

<p>you can compare the three above and choose one as your tool.</p>
