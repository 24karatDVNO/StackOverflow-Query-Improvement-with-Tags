<p>We created wrapper controls that do pretty much what you described.  Each of our server controls emits a div with a specified class, a label (if label text is set) and the control itself.</p>

<p>We've found this to be the absolute cleanest way to get the markup we want when it goes to the client; and it results in non-table forms.</p>

<p>We also have several classes defined such as "row", "shortRow", etc.  that set the appropriate width of the outer div and others which control the label and control width.  </p>
