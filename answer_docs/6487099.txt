<p>I'm not a python zen master, but here's my take.</p>

<pre><code>import random

#You have you read everything into a list from at least one of the files.
fin = open("filename1","r").readlines()
# tuple of all of the files.
fls = ( open("filename2","r"), 
       open("filename3","r"), )

for fl in fls: #iterate through tuple
   curr = 0
   clen = len(fin)
   for line in fl: #iterate through a file.
      # If we're at the end or 1 is randomly chosen, insert at current position.
      if curr &gt; clen or round(random.random()):
         fin.insert(curr,line)
         clen = len(fin)
      curr +=1 #increment current index.

# when you're *done* reverse. It's easier.
fin.reverse()
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately with this it becomes obvious that this is a weighted distrobution. This can be fixed by calculating the length of each of the files and multiplying the call to random by certain probability based on that. I'll see if I can't provide that at some later point.</p>
