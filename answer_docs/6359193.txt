<p>WSDL does have a capability to contain "wsdl:document" tags for adding documentation but for programmatic access you'd probably want to a custom soap headers. This <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/paolopia/archive/2008/02/25/handling-custom-soap-headers-via-wcf-behaviors.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">blog post</a> shows how you could use the custom headers. The <a href="http://wcfextras.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WCF Extras code</a> has some neat behaviors to do both custom soap headers and wsdl document tags. @marc_s answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/655234/adding-comments-to-a-wsdl-output-from-wcf-net">this question</a> is another approach.</p>
