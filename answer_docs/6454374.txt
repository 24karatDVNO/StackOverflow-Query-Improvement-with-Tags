<p>Speech recognition is always imprecise, you can't expect some code to work 100% of the time. It might work in 90% and fail in 10%. That 90% should be sufficient to build the application.</p>

<p>The question is not why it fails, the question is how often does it fail. You need to collect some statistics on that. If it fails 1 time of 20 it's expected. If it fails 10 times of 20 attempts, it's most likely in issue.</p>

<p>If you think it's still an issue you need to do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Record audio you are trying to recognize</li>
<li>Share it on CMUSphinx forum so developers can take a look on it.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can learn about concepts of speech recognition in CMUSphinx tutorial</p>
