<p>Are you .NET (NCover) or Java (Emma) or both?</p>

<p>NCover should work with Hudson but costs</p>

<p>Open Source projects exist look for <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/partcover.net4" rel="nofollow">PartCover</a> and more recently <a href="https://github.com/sawilde/opencover" rel="nofollow">OpenCover</a>.</p>

<p>All three .NET tools support command-line and as such they should integrate with Hudson.</p>
