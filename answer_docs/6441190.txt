<p>this is a simple query that gives you all the data. now you just have to split the top_scores by /,/ and then add them up in your code. an alternative is a stored procedure but i think this is simpler. good luck.</p>

<pre><code>select GROUP_CONCAT(score ORDER BY score DESC) top_scores
from userscore
group by userid
</code></pre>
