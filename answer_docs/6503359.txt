<p>You can create derived class from 'KeyedCollection' <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132438.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms132438.aspx</a>. 
Let's assume it will contain items of 'SomeItem' class. That class have properties Id, Name and some others. Set this KeyedCollection as ComboBox datasource. Then set ValueMemeber = "Id", DisplayMember = "Name"; After that you can cast "SelectedItem" to 'SomeItem' class and work with it.</p>
