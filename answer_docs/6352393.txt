<p>If you plan on a Deployment Target for your apps lower than iOS 4.3, you will need to find an armv6 architecture device on which to test, preferably running the iOS version of the lowest version iOS Deployment Target which you plan on supporting.  armv6 devices include the iPhone 2G, 3G and the 1st and 2nd gen iPod Touch.  </p>

<p>The 3GS has a newer CPU that runs armv7, so that's fine for Deployment Targets of 4.3 and above.</p>
