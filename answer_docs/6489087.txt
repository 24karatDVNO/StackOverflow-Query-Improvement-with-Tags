<p>Well, it seems i have figured out the problem.
It was simply a matter of emitting the 'variableChanged' signals when the ACCEPT button was clicked. This would update the variables in the MainGUI class.</p>

<p>It seems I had found the solution (read my comment), but I had misread the output my program gave, thus I had not realized that I had solved the problem until much later.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your comments. I'm sorry that this turned out to be such a waste of time.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
