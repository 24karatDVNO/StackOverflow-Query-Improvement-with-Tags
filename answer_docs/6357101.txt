<p>if you don't have a lot of things in your hash, you could just loop on the keys and dereference them. What has to happen for this to work is:</p>

<ol>
<li>you have to add the key/values in the order you want them.</li>
<li>be using 1.9 (I believe it was in 1.9 that they made it so that key ordering is retained in hashes)</li>
</ol>
