<p>this looks really complicated... I have a much smaller solution. I never tried it on https but I think this will also work.</p>

<p>Just set the credentials for your http client:</p>

<pre><code>httpClient = new DefaultHttpClient();
String user = prefs.getString("http_auth_username", "");
String pwd = prefs.getString("http_auth_password", "");
httpClient.getCredentialsProvider().setCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, new UsernamePasswordCredentials(user, pwd));
</code></pre>

<p>Then you do not have to set the auth header manually.</p>
