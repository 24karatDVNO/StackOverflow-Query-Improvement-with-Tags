<p>Which datasource are you using ? I strongly suggest <strong>freebase</strong> it's a free database within more than 12 millions of voices and it provides a web services for the autosuggestion (included js functions) in the most miscellanous fields (jobs, sports, actors, movies or whatever you wish)... not everybody knows about it but google bought the project last year (it still available and free) so it should be a promising web service for datasources.</p>
