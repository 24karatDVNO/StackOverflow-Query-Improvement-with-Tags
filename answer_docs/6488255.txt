<p>Yes. I think it's a good idea to implement the Observer pattern (Notification Center) in user interfaces; specifically because doing so allows you to easily add features and functionality later in the life of the application. I think it would be wise to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern" rel="nofollow">Observer Design Pattern</a> for your Notification Center. You should consider reading Apple's implementation of their Cocoa Framework's Notification Center for inspiration and examples on usage.</p>
