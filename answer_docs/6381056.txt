<p>If your OS image includes ActiveSync, you could try to install a virtual (software-based) serial port, and connect ActiveSync on your workstation with the one on your virtual device. I have not tested this myself in Windows CE but in theory it should work. I found a commercial virtual serial port software <a href="http://www.mks.zp.ua/vspdxp.php" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and an open source one <a href="http://com0com.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br><br>
If your OS image does not support ActiveSync, you could still try this approach using two serial port-based file transfer applications, for example hyperterminal on your workstation and <a href="http://www.tsreader.com/ztermce/index.html" rel="nofollow">Zterm CE</a> on Windows CE.</p>
