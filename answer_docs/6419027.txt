<p>Without the specific code that fails it's hard to help you.  But... according to FB's privacy settings, a user can choose which details to make available to applications:</p>

<p><strong>From facebook:</strong></p>

<p><em>Choose Your Privacy Settings>Apps, Games and Websites></em>
"Control what information is available to apps and websites when your friends use them."</p>

<p>It's possible that some user's have denied specific permissions and that's why it's returning an error.  See <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/permissions/" rel="nofollow">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/fql/permissions/</a> to check granted permissions by uid.</p>

<p>But do show us the code :)</p>
