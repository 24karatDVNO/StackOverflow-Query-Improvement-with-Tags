<p>You could subtract 40 from the x-values for your second functions to make the range of x-values continuous. This would give you a range from 0% to 70%. Then you can make set the tics and labes of the x-axis as follows:</p>

<pre><code>x_ticks = range(71, 0, 10)
a.set_xticks(x_ticks)
a.set_xticklabels([str(x) for x in [0, 10, 20, 30, 70, 80, 90, 100]])
</code></pre>

<p>Where <code>a</code> is the current axes. So basically, you plot your functions in the range from 0% to 70%, but label the axis with a gap.</p>

<p>To illustrate - the following script:</p>

<pre><code>from numpy import arange
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x1 = arange(0, 26) # first function
y1 = x1**2

x2 = arange(75, 100) # second function
y2 = x2*4 + 10

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.plot(x1, y1)
ax.plot(x2 - 40, y2) # shift second function 40 to left
ax.set_xticks(range(0, 61, 5)) # set custom x-ticks
# set labels for x-ticks - labels have the gap we want
ax.set_xticklabels([str(x) for x in range(0, 26, 5) + range(70, 101, 5)])
plt.show()
</code></pre>

<p>Produces the following plot (note the x-labels):</p>
