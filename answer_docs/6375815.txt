<p>If you want to distribute the results evenly in the maximum number of pages, which is 3 as you have suggested, you can use:</p>

<pre><code>$results_per_page = ($totalfiles/$maxpages);
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, you already have the number of results per page calculated on your $limit variable.</p>
