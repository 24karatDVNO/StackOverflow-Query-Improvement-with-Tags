<p>Just add this to whatever divs you want to be centered.  This should work on all browsers and will keep everything centered no matter the resolution.</p>

<pre><code>#div {  
    margin:0 auto;
    text-align:center;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would suggest using this for the main content div, so everything is centered, then creating separate divs for the video, links, etc.  That way you can position those where you want them inside the centered div..</p>
