<p>This could be the result of jQuery AJAX caching. I've had similar problems myself.</p>

<p>Try turning it off with this:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({
    type: "POST",
    url: "check.php",
    data: { value: 'true' },
    cache: false
});
</code></pre>

<p>Also try fiddling the requests to check whether they're actually being made or not to confirm that it's a caching issue.</p>
