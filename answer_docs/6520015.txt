<p>Usually something like this is done with three tables:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>People(id, name, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Languages(id, name, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>SpokenLanguages(peopleID, languageID)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...where SpokenLanguages is an association table that uses foreign keys to associate each person with the languages he/she speaks.</p>
