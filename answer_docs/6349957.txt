<p>I've got a similar quandary in that overflow:auto stuff appears properly when the dom element is within the viewport, but once the element has moved above or below the viewport, it's content breaks free and becomes visible.</p>

<p>To answer your "what browser is that anyway", the User Agent I got during my tests was:</p>

<pre><code>Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 3.1; en-us; Xoom Build/HMJ37) AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/534.13
</code></pre>

<p>The interface certainly <em>looks</em> like Chrome, but I guess it's a custom browser(?)
Paste that into <a href="http://useragentstring.com" rel="nofollow">http://useragentstring.com</a> to get a pretty good analysis of the agent string.</p>
