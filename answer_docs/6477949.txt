<p>Ternary means three terms.  You must have a condition, a true part, and a false part.  It takes the place of if condition then true part else false part.  You can't leave out the third part.  There is a shortcut in 5.3 that allows you to leave out the true part if the condition can be used also as the true part but it still really has three terms.</p>
