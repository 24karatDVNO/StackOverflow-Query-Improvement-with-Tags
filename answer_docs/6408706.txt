<p>I think you're right with your guess, as <a href="http://www.mediatel.lu/workshop/graphic/3D_fileformat/h_3ds2.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> they say about A351:</p>

<pre><code>If read as a short int (ls byte first):

bit4 bit0: 00 tile (default) 11 decal  01 both
bit 1: mirror
bit 2: not used ? (0)
bit 3: negative
bit 5: summed area map filtering (instead of pyramidal)
bit 6: use alpha  (toggles RGBluma/alpha. For masks RGB means RGBluma)
bit 7: there is a one channel tint (either RGBluma or alpha)
bit 8: ignore alpha (take RGBluma even if an alpha exists (?))
bit 9: there is a three channel tint (RGB tint)
... not used (0)
</code></pre>

<p>I think the <code>tile</code> option (bits 0 and 4) could be what you're looking for. I guess when <code>tile</code> is on, the texCoords are repeated and otherwise they're clamped.</p>
