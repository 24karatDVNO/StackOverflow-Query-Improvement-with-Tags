<p>I think honestly you can do it either way.   I have an app that is a paged scroll view that has an ADBannerView just off screen (below).  When an add gets loaded the scroll view shortens by the height of the ADBannerView and the AdBannerView gets moved up.  Its the same object for each page of the UIScrollView.</p>

<p>Some might argue though that my app is really only 1 view, since each 'page' is part of the same ScrollView.</p>
