<p>Well, I just ended up manually loading the assemblies. As in using Assembly.LoadFrom(relative path string)</p>

<p>I tried suffixing them but it started complaining it didn't match the app.manifest file.</p>

<p>The assembly resolve event also didn't work, because the reportviewer control didn't fire assemblyresolve for all of the dlls. Maybe because it's in it's own appdomain.</p>

<p>Anyway, this seems to work for now.</p>
