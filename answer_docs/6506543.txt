<p>As others have suggested, tracking a pointer is good way of knowing if memory has been freed or not.</p>

<p>I would also suggest the following pointers.</p>

<ol>
<li>Initialiase the pointer to NULL while you declare it</li>
<li>Once freed you initialise it to NULL again</li>
<li>Check if pointer is not NULL before trying to free.</li>
</ol>
