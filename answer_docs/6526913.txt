<p>Well if you are using jQuery you should be able to do some checking of the url in document ready... </p>

<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() {
    // put all your jQuery goodness in here.
});
</code></pre>

<p>I don't know off the top of my head if / what the js function is that gets called when the page is done loading.</p>

<p>Then you should be able to something along the lines of...

<p>To call the method. I don't know if you could call the js directly from the URL but this might be a work around, instead of using the js function you'd need to set a flag and then you could trigger the method.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
