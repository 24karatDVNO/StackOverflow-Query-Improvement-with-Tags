<p>This compiles to what appears to be functionally equivalent code, with the advantage of being much shorter.  I would suggest using the coffeescript real-time compiler at <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/" rel="nofollow">http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/</a> for testing things like this.</p>

<pre><code>promptLogin = (login_level, callback) -&gt;
  FB.login (response) -&gt;
    callback response.session and response.perms, response
    return
  , perms:'email,publish_stream'
  return
</code></pre>

<p>The returns may be unnecessary depending on whether the return values of those functions matter.</p>
