<p>There seems to be two errors in your declaration, the order is wrong and the url is to the image is some sort of mix between absolute and relative.</p>

<p>background: url(http:/appimages/background.gif) #fff bottom left repeat-x;</p>

<p>Should probably be</p>

<pre><code>background: #fff url(appimages/background.gif) repeat-x scroll left bottom;
</code></pre>

<p>or if the images is really on another server</p>

<pre><code>background: #fff url(http://www.yourdomain.com/appimages/background.gif) repeat-x scroll left bottom;
</code></pre>

<p>Scroll is default and can be omitted..</p>
