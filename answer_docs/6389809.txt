<p>I found the answer - it's in the order of execution. I thought one of the triggers wasn't being fired - in this case the Index_Change_Trans trigger - but in fact it was. I didn't see the results, however, because this trigger is relying on entries in the Docs table. </p>

<pre><code>INSERT INTO 
DOCID_SYNC (IS_DOC_ID, CRTN_DT, SYNC_STATUS_CDE)
SELECT DOCID, GETDATE(), "N" FROM DOCS
WHERE Transnum = (SELECT Inserted.TransNum from Inserted)
</code></pre>

<p>So, in cases where the Trans table was updated before the Docs table, the run of the Trans trigger would not show an update in the Docid_Sync table - since at this point there were no entries in the Docs table with the appropriate Transnum value. In these cases, the Docid_Sync table only has one entry, the result of the Docs trigger.</p>

<p>In other instances, the Docs table is updated first, and then the Trans table. In these instances, the Docid_Sync table has two entries - one as the result of the Docs trigger, and another as the result of the Trans trigger.</p>
