<p>Since C# has operator overloading and <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code> are overloaded the responsibility should fall to the person person modifying your code should know to check if the operator <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code> is overloaded before assuming that it is doing an Object comparison.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong>
If you wanted to do a reference comparison you can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>if( (object)a == b )
</code></pre>
