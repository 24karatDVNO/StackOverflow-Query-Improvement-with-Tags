<p>If you'd designed your class to have accessors and mutators, rather than public access to raw variables, then this would be easy.</p>

<p>Original code:</p>

<pre><code>class user {
   private $FirstName = '';

   public function getFirstName() {
      return $this-&gt;FirstName;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Solution code:</p>

<pre><code>class user {
   private $FirstName = '';

   public function getFirstName() {
      return utf8_encode($this-&gt;FirstName);
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I suggest moving towards this approach.</p>

<p>Otherwise no, the object cannot do it automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p><code>__set</code> and <code>__get</code> might be the most appropriate way to implement this. I'm not too familiar with them, and it doesn't really matter: the point I'm making here is to use accessors and mutators... however you end up implementing them.</p>
