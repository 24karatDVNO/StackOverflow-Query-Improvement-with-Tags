<p>My suggestion is you can use jave.net.httpurlconnect to send a request to this server, the format is like this:
<a href="http://vnsky.biz/search/search.php?keyword=you" rel="nofollow">http://vnsky.biz/search/search.php?keyword=you</a> word to search</p>

<p>and you will get a response which contains the search result. you may have a look at the response format and parse the link or text from the response for yourself.</p>
