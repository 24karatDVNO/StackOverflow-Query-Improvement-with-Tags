<p>Going on the error message alone it looks like you are defining class module_info in each of your includes.  It should be defined once and included in each of your module files creating a new instance for each one.  Even though the module information of a new include will override that of the previous you could add to the details to an array if you need to reference it later on:</p>

    ...

    $modules_info = array();

    while ($file = readdir($handler)) {
    if ($file != "." && $file != "..") {
        if($num == 1) {
            $cla = "hvr";
            $num = 0;
        } else {
            $cla = "blu";
            $num = 1;
        }

    //Load Modules Info
    include_once("../includes/modules/payment/".$file);

    $modules_info[basename($file)] = $module_info;
