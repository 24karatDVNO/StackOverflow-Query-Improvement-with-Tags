<p>maybe you could use a subselect and so something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM
  products
WHERE
  (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM
    characteristics
  WHERE product = products.id AND characteristics_id IN (1,2,3)
  ) &gt;= 3;
</code></pre>

<p>note that this isn't tested because you havn't posted your exact table-definitions.</p>
