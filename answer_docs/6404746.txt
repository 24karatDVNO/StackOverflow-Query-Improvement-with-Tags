<p>Depending on how much work you want to put in this one, I would suggest looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal" rel="nofollow">Tree Traversal Algorithms</a> (check the column on the right), things like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A%2a_search_algorithm" rel="nofollow">A* <em>alpha star</em></a>, that you can use to find your find from one point to another, even if obstacles are in-between. </p>
