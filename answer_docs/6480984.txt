<p>If you just want to check if it is likely that one image is a quick edit of another for something like DRM of stock photography then check the percentages of a normalized color palette within probable regions. If they match within an THRESHOLD for a NUMBER_OF_TEST_COLORS in any one of a number of TEST_REGIONS within the image then you have a "suspect"... you still need a human to check the suspects. But this is a quick and dirty way to find many of the image re-sizers, horiz/vert flippers, and background color changers, file format changers, and other subtle variations... of course "normalizing the colors" to a quantized palette is an art unto itself. I would recommend quantizing images into nearest "web safe" colors for practicality. </p>

<p>I'm a blue collar garbage man in comparison to a mathematician, but garbage men are quite practical! I have had good success with this kind of approach in grouping similar images and search by color applications.</p>
