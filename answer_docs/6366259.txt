<p>I would add the following plugin:</p>

<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/redirection/" rel="nofollow">http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/redirection/</a></p>

<p>And then create blank pages or posts in WordPress to get the link structure you want.  The plugin adds an option to the post edit screen to set a 301 redirect to your other URL. That should provide the mechanics of what you want to do.</p>

<p>As for SEO, it's suboptimal for the new site since spiders, visitors, and bookmarks will all end up on the old site.   I would use the above as a temporary solution and slowly copy/paste the content over or figure out a clever database import to move it over.  In the long run, that will be better for you.</p>
