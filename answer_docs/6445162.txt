<p>I had to implement a similar feature , here is what I did . I implemented the following outside <code>getview</code></p>

<ul>
<li>OnTouchListener - to listen to seekbar touch events</li>
<li>OnKeyListener - to listen to dpad and trakball event for the seekbar</li>
</ul>

<p>I set these listeners for the seekbars from <code>getView</code></p>

<p>Whenever the listeners were called , I would find the seekbars parent , then do the <code>findviewbyid</code> from the parent to the textview. </p>

<p>So now I have the textview which I have to update, and the seekbar.  All I need to do was set the text from the array. </p>

<p>here is some code to help you.</p>

<p>private OnTouchListener touchListener = new OnTouchListener() {</p>

<pre><code>    @Override
    public boolean onTouch(View v, MotionEvent event) {
            View parent = (View) v.getParent();
            TextView textView = (TextView) parent
                    .findViewById(R.id.id_grade_tooltip);
            if (textView == null) {
            } else {
                SeekBar seekBar = (SeekBar) v;
                textView.setText(String.valueOf(seekBar.getProgress())
                        + "%");
            }
            return false;
    }
};
</code></pre>
