<p>Check this <a href="http://www.eggheadcafe.com/software/aspnet/34122841/making-listview-columns-read-only.aspx" rel="nofollow">this</a> or <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/winforms/thread/6cec829f-8f5f-4476-a2fc-772d155e7e6d" rel="nofollow">this</a>. You have to make the columns read-only. Check for properties like readonly, labeledit, editable etc. Must be possible. Else the links will help you further. I use DevExpress grids and there it's easily possible (but those components are very customizable and much more advanced than standard Microsoft .NET ui components imho).</p>
