<p>The aspx page had the following code to keep the page from getting cached:</p>

<pre><code>// Never cache this page
Response.CacheControl = "no-cache";
Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache");
Response.Expires = -1;
</code></pre>

<p>Removing the first 2 lines and leaving only <code>Response.Expires = -1</code> resolved the issue.  For some reason this was preventing the image from working properly in IE.</p>
