<p>This seems less restrictive in that it doesn't specifically <em>exclude</em> use for non-merchant uses but I'm pretty certain trademark law would still apply (depending on your jurisdiction of course) and you may get into trouble for misrepresentation.</p>

<p>In any case, the best bet in <em>both</em> cases is to ask the organisations themselves. If you get permission in writing from the owners of the marks, it's a hard task for them to convince the legal system that you're doing something wrong (unless you use it in a way they <em>didn't</em> give you permission for).</p>
