<p>I'm not sure if this helps but you can see what I've done with jQuery Finder: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jqueryfinder/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/jqueryfinder/</a> (the demo link does not work, so you'll have to checkout the trunk)</p>

<p>It's pretty much abandoned so I'd love it if someone else would pick it up.</p>
