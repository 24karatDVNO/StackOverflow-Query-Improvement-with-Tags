<p>The HTML code you refer to shows that all toolbar related stuff happens in a cascade of <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> all named <strong><em>...wibiya...</em></strong>. Googeling this we end up at <a href="http://www.wibiya.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wibiya.com/</a> which has all the info.</p>

<p>Doing a bit more reading of the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> of reference we see wibiya is based on jQuery and needs a library .... should be easy to implement</p>
