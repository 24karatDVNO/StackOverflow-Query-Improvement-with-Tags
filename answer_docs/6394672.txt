<p>As I always say to people who's learning something new or improving their knowledgements: "No pain, no gain". </p>

<p>Get through the Agile Web Development book (I'd recommend you the 4th edition though as it deals with Rails 3). Also, take a look at this tutorial: <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html" rel="nofollow">http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html</a>, watch some <a href="http://railscasts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/</a> for best practices, play around with the rails console (rails c in the project directory) and just make your own application! </p>

<p>Think about something cool you'd like to achieve, even if you still have no idea how it should be done. You will get some decent basic knowledges in no time! Personally, I started programming on Rails 3 weeks ago and today I already have done a complete manager with ldap user authentication, ssh connections, XML parsing and YAML writing, stuff I wouldn't imagine I'd be able to do in so little time...</p>
