<p>When OpenCV was built using 'WITH_QT_OPENGL', above problem occures.</p>

<p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Build OpenCV without 'WITH_QT_OPENGL' option.  It will completely removes all errors.</li>
<li>Or to work around- Re-attach the draw buffer (i.e. glDrawBuffer only with default buffer object or with framebuffer object (FBO) both FBO and texture/render buffer, you could valid this using 'glCheckFramebufferStatusEXT(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_EXT);' )</li>
</ol>
