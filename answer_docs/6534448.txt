<p>This is not possible as the node form alteration is hard-coded in the module. Here is an issue related to this - <a href="http://drupal.org/node/332073" rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/node/332073</a>. However, if you are not averse to editing the module, then you can achieve it. The code is in hook_form_alter of formfilter_ui module.</p>
