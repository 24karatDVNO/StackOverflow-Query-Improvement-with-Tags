<p>You will have saved in the database that your site url was <a href="http://localhost" rel="nofollow">http://localhost</a>. To access it from everywhere, I'd use your IP address instead, that way you should be able to see it on your local and external machines.</p>

<p>Do a quick export of your db, open in a text editor.</p>

<p>Find/ replace 'localhost' and change it to whatever your computer's IP is.</p>

<p>Import your changed sql file. Should be all good :)</p>
