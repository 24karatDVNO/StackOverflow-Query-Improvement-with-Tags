<p>Certainly a MySQL query can reference any database that lives in the same instance of MySQL.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM `databasename`.`tablename` ...
</code></pre>

<p>And it's also easy to get the list of database names if the attacker can use SQL injection to execute arbitrary queries as root:</p>

<pre><code>SHOW DATABASES;
</code></pre>

<p>Or:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISTINCT table_schema FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES;
</code></pre>

<p>I encourage you to perform a thorough code review of all your code and be safer about writing dynamic SQL queries.  You can use proper type coercion, string-escaping functions, and query parameters for most cases, but there are still more cases where you need to build dynamic SQL strings and those solutions don't help. </p>
