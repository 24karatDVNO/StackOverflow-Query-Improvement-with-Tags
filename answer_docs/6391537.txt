<p>Yeah. When you have double quoted strings, and you put a dollar sign and something else in it, it  interprets it as a variable. (it also escape things like <code>\n</code>)</p>

<p>Example</p>

<pre><code>$test = "hi";
echo "$test world"; //This outputs hi world
</code></pre>

<p>In your case, <code>$Q</code> doesn't exist. The default PHP behaviour is to ignore that error and just puts out nothing. This is why it's recommended to report all problems with your code. Check out

<p>Solution to your problem would be using single quoted strings. do <code>$a = '$Q'.$i;</code></p>
