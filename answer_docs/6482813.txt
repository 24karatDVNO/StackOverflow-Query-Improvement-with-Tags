<p>The timer objects in the .net framework do not give access to the time already elapsed or remaining.</p>

<p>However when your application starts you will can create and start a stop watch.</p>

<pre><code>private _sw as System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew()
</code></pre>

<p>At any time you can then call the following code which you can subtract from your 30 minutes</p>

<pre><code>_sw.Elapsed.TotalSeconds
</code></pre>

<p>To show this time constantly on  a form you may need a second timer to update the screen that queries this value.</p>
