<p>Section 5.17 of the ISO standard says</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are several assignment
  operators, all of which group
  right-to-left. All require a
  modifiable lvalue as their left
  operand, and the type of an assignment
  expression is that of its left
  operand. The result of the assignment
  operation is the value stored in the
  left operand after the assignment has
  taken place; the result is an lvalue.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is because the overloaded operator for the '=' does not match any of your provided overloaded instances. </p>

<p>You need to initialize it as Line * not simply Line and it should work. Better if you overload void* (e.g. new).</p>
