<p>MyAppDelegateClass *appDelegate = [[UIApplication sharedApplicaton] delegate];
myLocalProperty = appDelegate.someDataModelProperty;</p>

<p>There is a spelling error in this code 'sharedApplicaton' is incorrectly spelled it should be 'sharedApplication'.</p>

<p>Shame on me for copy and pasting!  Anyway this will work for a quick and dirty way of passing data between ViewControllers etc.</p>
