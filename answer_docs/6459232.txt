<p>I had this problem when I started using Entity Framework, it happened when I did not change the old SQL server connection to EntityFrameWork connection. </p>

<p>Solution: 
in the file where connection is made through web.config file  "add name="<strong>Entities</strong>" connectionString=XYZ", 
make sure you are referring to the correct connection, in my case I had to do this</p>

<pre><code>        public static string MyEntityFrameworkConnection
    {
        get
        {
             return ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["Entities"].ConnectionString;
        }

    }
</code></pre>

<p>call MyEntityFrameworkConnection whenever connection need to be established.</p>

<pre><code>private string strConnection= Library.DataAccessLayer.DBfile.AdoSomething.MyEntityFrameworkConnection;
</code></pre>

<p>note: the connection in web.config file will be generated automatically when adding Entity model to the solution. </p>
