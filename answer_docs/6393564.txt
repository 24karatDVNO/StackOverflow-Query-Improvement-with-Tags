<p>I am <strong>very</strong> new to RoR, but i was wondering if you can user <code>ProfilePicture.find_by_owner(owner_id)</code>
or</p>

<pre><code>ProfilePicture.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM ProfilePicture WHERE owner.id = current_user.id")
</code></pre>

<p>Dunno, just throwing my two cents (and trying to learn Ruby on Rails)</p>

<p>--EDIT--</p>

<p>By the way, i think <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5979625/retrieving-objects-from-the-database-advanced-array-conditions">this post</a> could be useful.</p>
