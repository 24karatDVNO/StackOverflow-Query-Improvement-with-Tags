<p>Spoke with the vendor, and other than initial set up issues, this was only happening on table where there is a nightly sync that supercedes the daily changes.  i.e. replication and cdc run during the day to capture near real time changes, during nightly batch, the table is truncated and recalculated.  The gave me a methodology to detect when this is taking place, so that I can cleanly turn off CDC and restart when the process is complete.</p>
