<p>I suppose you're using a standard login form along with the Membership API. When using SQL Server Express Edition in conjunction with ASP.NET, the SqlMembershipProvider is able to create a data store that will be used by your membership provider automatically for you. However, when using any other edition of SQL Server, you have to create this data storage manually.</p>

<p>You can use the aspnet_regsql.exe tool and then configure your connection strings.</p>
