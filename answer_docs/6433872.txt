<p>Do you have caching turned on in your application? Does the problem occur more or less when you do a full refresh?</p>

<p>Is facebook limiting your calls to the authentication API? </p>

<p>Does fandjango properly cache those? Does your problem show up most often if you refresh the page a bunch of times, but goes away if you leave it alone for a while and come back? </p>

<p>Are you actually running the latest version of fandjango?</p>
