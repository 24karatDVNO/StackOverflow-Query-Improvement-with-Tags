<p>Choose menu 
    Debug --> Exceptions...</p>

<p>and then just unclick all "User-unhandled" exceptions to only have the debugger break on your break points.</p>

<p>The option I find useful as a general approach to letting the debugger work for you when you aren't looking for a needle in a haystack is to click on User-unhandled exceptions for Common CLR Exceptions.</p>
