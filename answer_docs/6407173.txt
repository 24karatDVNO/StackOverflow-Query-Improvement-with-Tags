<p>I guess this as nothing do do specificaly with WPF. You can link almost any .net collection/data collector object to WPF data grid.</p>

<p>But your problem stands way before that and concerns .net data access in general. You should remove the WPF tag from your question and rather see what ADO. net can do for you.</p>

<p>Once this is done and that you have the content of your FoxPro db in a .net collection, then you will worry about WPF ;)</p>
