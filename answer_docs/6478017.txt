<p>when setting up your membership provider you will run a regsql command that will create the schema in your data store (whatever store you are using) and put the connection string in your web.config.  You could use any datastore that .Net has a provider for (ORACLE, MYSql, SQLite, SQL Server, MS Access, etc).</p>
