<p>Last January it was widely stated by big developers that about 90% had already upgraded to iOS4.  A long time has gone by since then, and through anecdotal discussion with other developers I am left with an impression that only a couple percent of users who would bother installing anything still have iOS 3.  I haven't seen a pre 3gs iPhone on the streets since last year.</p>

<p>I suggest that most developers should <em>target iOS 4+ if they can make good use of its new features.</em></p>
