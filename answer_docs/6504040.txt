<p>I assume you mean the mapping of your db objects to the <code>CustomerEventDto</code> object right?</p>

<p>Short answer: Yes, it <em>should</em> be possible.</p>

<p>Longer answer: Yes, you should be able to use AutoMapper for these transformations, only the setup will be a bit complicated I think. Maybe it will work out of the box though...</p>

<p>hmm, I was writing a little code example, but while writing it I realized it probably won't be that easy as it seems, as you want to project a few DB Objects to 1 <code>CustomerEventDto</code> object. I think the complex setup probably isn't worth the trouble...</p>

<p>So my conclusion for now is that it is not possible. If you or anyone else does find a solution, please post it so I can also use this technique in the future!</p>

<p>Sorry that I can't be of any more help.</p>
