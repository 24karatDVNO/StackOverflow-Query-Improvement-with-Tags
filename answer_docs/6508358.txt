<p>The question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Blockquote "return me all table where age is less than 24?" </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Implies that you would have more than one table with a column called age.  If the age applies to the runner I would suggest reviewing your schema.  You should have an entity named something like:</p>

<p>Person
or
Runner
or
Participant</p>

<p>That has a column age.  The trick would then be to simply move all your data into that table.  Then a simple</p>

<p>SELECT
   *
FROM
   Person
WHERE
   age &lt; 24</p>

<p>Would return all the data you're looking for.</p>

<p>I think where this is getting confusing is the concept of a datasheet in excel vs. a table in SQL.  Your data sheets sound like they're instances of a participant with various additional data.  Instead of creating a table for each data sheet you should create a schema that fits all of your data and then fill it with each instance from your data.</p>
