<p>Actually it is caused by Scrollview creating a buffer to contain the view at each possible position of the scrollbar to enable fast and smooth scrolling.  Since a MapView is pretty large when the tiles are loaded during the measure phase then the resulting buffer created by ScrollView can be huge (around 128 M).  Unless you set your emulator to have more than 256 M of ram and heap space, it will fail with an out of memory error.  You could set your emulator to have 512M of ram and heap space but your app would crash on any device that has less than 512M of ram or insufficient heap space.  The best thing to do is to remove the MapView from the ScrollView.</p>
