<p>I think your question assumes that there are only 2 classes and one of them is what you call Collections.  Let me say that I also call lists, maps, sets, etc. Collections because they're part of the Collections API.  However, Collection is not on the same abstraction level as a primitive data type like integer.   Really, you have primitives and references.  References are pointers to objects which are instances of classes.  Classes can be classified many ways.  One of these classifications is "Collections".</p>

<p>Your friend who says "hashtable vector" is pretty much wrong if there's only one table.  A hash table is a hash table, and a vector is a vector.  A hashtable vector is a <code>Vector&lt;Hashtable&gt;</code> as far as I'm concerned.</p>
