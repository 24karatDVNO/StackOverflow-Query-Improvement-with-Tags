<p>Warning: Speculation :)</p>

<p>Probably not.  Something this central to the "feel" of a UI would not translate well across different input device types, or even different builds of the same device type.</p>

<p>For example, one touch-screen might be much more sensitive than another.  Another device might be more erratic, and require more software "de-bouncing", and hence more time to make the double-tap distinction.</p>

<p>Also, this setting is usually configurable for greater accessibility by those who are less dexterous (e.g. children, elderly, and the disabled).</p>

<p>For a direct counter-example, in Windows, it is configurable:</p>
