<p>Maybe the faux columns technique is what you need. Check it out <a href="http://dustinbrewer.com/using-faux-columns-for-same-column-height/" rel="nofollow">here</a>, <a href="http://www.ejeliot.com/blog/61" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fauxcolumns/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you need it to be liquid or with no images (for whatever reason) then you might have to use some javascript like <a href="http://www.it-base.ro/2007/09/20/equal-height-divs/" rel="nofollow">this example</a> or you can check <a href="http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/equal-height-columns-cross-browser-css-no-hacks" rel="nofollow">this weird example</a>.</p>

<p>Anyway, with the little information there's not too much to offer because there's a lot of variables and different solutions.</p>
