<p>Are you just looking for a script that asks you for confirmation before continuing?  You can do that with echo and read:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cmd="some command"
echo -n "press enter to execute: $cmd"
read
$cmd
</code></pre>

<p>You can even wrap that up into a general utility function:</p>

<p>function exec_with_confirm () {
      cmd="$@"
      echo -n "press enter to execute: $cmd "
      read
      $@
    }</p>

<pre><code>exec_with_confirm ls -l
exec_with_confirm du -sk .
</code></pre>

<p>This only goes so far, it won't work with shell meta-characters, to handle those you'd need to modify the function to take a string and pass it to bash -c, and send it quoted strings.</p>

<p>If your intent is just to have a confirmation before execution, this should solve that.</p>

<p>If your intent is to have it be placed on your next command line, then this won't do that.</p>
