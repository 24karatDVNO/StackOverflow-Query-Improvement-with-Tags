<p>Just override "after_sign_out_path_for" in your application controller and reset your token in there.  No need to write your own SessionController (although it is very simple as Nathan mentioned).</p>

<p>Here's the method you should use: <a href="http://rubydoc.info/gems/devise/1.3.4/frames" rel="nofollow">http://rubydoc.info/gems/devise/1.3.4/frames</a>
- (Object) after_sign_out_path_for(resource_or_scope)</p>

<p>Method used by sessions controller to sign out a user. You can overwrite it in your ApplicationController to provide a custom hook for a custom scope. Notice that differently from after_sign_in_path_for this method receives a symbol with the scope, and not the resource.</p>

<p>By default is the root_path. </p>
