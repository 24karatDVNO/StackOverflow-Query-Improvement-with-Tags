<p>The best place to start is with the <a href="http://tfsbranchingguideiii.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">branching guidance</a> produced by the ALM Rangers, the latest version is for TFS 2010 but it's applicable to 2008. If you're building software as products then the guidance is very good, if you're building in house software then I'd suggest droping the idea of a service pack branch.</p>
