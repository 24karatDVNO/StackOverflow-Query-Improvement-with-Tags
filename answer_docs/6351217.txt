<p>As much as I hate to post a "me too" non-answer, this isn't as easy as it appears. The screen that's spawned isn't the workflow screen, nor the default screen, nor the screens that are configured for create/edit/view for the specified issue type in the relevant screen scheme. This is baffling.</p>
