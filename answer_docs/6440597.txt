<p>As I am doing instalaltion of components on showing the waitingDlg. Hnece the CPU stays busy and hence the UI thread couldn't paint the labels. I show and set the labels in my background thread's ReportProgress and call lthe installation in DoWork.</p>

<p>This solved the problem and shows everything nicely as expected.</p>

<p>Thanks to all of you for yout time and efforts.</p>
