<p>I don't think you need to be using animations for what you're doing.  It should just be something like:</p>

<pre><code>[objectName removeFromSuperview];
[superViewName addSubview:otherView];
</code></pre>

<p>To call your function, it should be:</p>

<pre><code>[object switchTheViews:viewController over:otherViewController];
</code></pre>
