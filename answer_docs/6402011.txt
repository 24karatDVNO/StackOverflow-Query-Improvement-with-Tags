<p>I have faced the same problem just yesterday. I looked around many sites with no answer. Then, I remebered that I have many XML editors that are installed on my Eclipse as a plugins. I think of Google Apps Engine, Tomcat ... Then I sais : maybe it's because of those plugins. So, I unzipped a new eclipse in a subdir, I download the ADT and everything just worked fine.</p>
