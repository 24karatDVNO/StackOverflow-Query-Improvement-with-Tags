<p>The way you have it sounds reasonable, although I'm not 100% sure I know what you mean without a little code or pseudocode. Still, if you don't like how it's structured, how about this: you can have a class that wraps the media player that maintains a queue of stuff to play. It still listens to onCompletion, this simply gets the next item off the queue and plays it. You can keep a separate "loader" sort of class which populates the queue onCompletion. This way you can separate concerns, keeping the player concerned about playing and a loader class with only loading.</p>
