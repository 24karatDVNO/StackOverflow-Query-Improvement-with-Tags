<p>Ok, as a workaround I ended up defining a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/#adding-custom-validation-to-the-admin" rel="nofollow">custom form</a> with <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/forms/validation/#cleaning-and-validating-fields-that-depend-on-each-other" rel="nofollow">my validation</a> in admin.py for this model.</p>

<p>I still don't understand why model.clean gets called before Django has determined that the required fields have been filled in.  Oh well.</p>
