<p>just my two pence worth: java doesn't allow the use of pointers as opposed to C/C++ or C#. So if you are going to manipulate pixels directly, i.e. write your own image processing functions then they will be much slower than the equivalent in C++. On the otherhand C++ is a total nightmare of a  language compared to java. it will take you at least twice as long to write the equivalent bit of code in c++. so with all the productivity gain you can probably afford to buy a computer that makes up for the difference in runtime ;-)</p>

<p>i know other languages aren't an option for you, but personally i can highly recommend c# for image processing or computer vision: it allows pointers and hence IP functions in c# are only half as slow as in C++ (an acceptable trade-off i think) and it has excellent integration with native C++ and a good wrapper library for opencv. </p>
