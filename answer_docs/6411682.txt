<p>The simplest thing might be to limit how long the guessed string is allowed to be. Don't allow guesses above a certain length.</p>

<p>I had a look at your code and I'm not good enough in Python to find any bugs, but it might be that you're simply referencing or indexing the array incorrectly, resulting in <em>always</em> adding new characters to the guess-string, so your string is always increasing in length... I don't know if that's the bug, but things like that have happened to me before, so double-check your array indicies. ;)</p>
