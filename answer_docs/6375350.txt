<p>Wouln't it be better to use CSS to achieve what you want?  If you only need a vertical spacing between your text and your image.  I would add a top margin to the image you are inserting throught javascript.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;asp:ContentPlaceHolder ID="ContentText" runat="server"&gt;
Your text is here
&lt;/asp:ContentPlaceHolder&gt;
&lt;img src="javascript-inserted-image.jpg" width="100" height="100" style="margin-top: 50px;" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In real life, I would be using a CSS class that I would assign to the image instead of applying the margin to the style attribute of the image.</p>

<p>Edited:</p>

<p>Your image would also need to be displayed as a block element (CSS style display: block;) if your the content of your place holder is not a block element like a p, div, blockquote, etc...</p>
