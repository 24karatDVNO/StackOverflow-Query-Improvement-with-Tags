<p>There is a solution that requires no javascript or detection of whether the stylesheet loaded.</p>

<p>It seems you could also apply your default style with a built-in style sheet and then have the dynamically loaded stylesheet override the defaults.  If the new stylesheet doesn't load, the default is already loaded and in place, nothing further to do.  If the new stylesheet does load, it just overrides the default values and shows the new style.</p>
