<p>Ladislav's post is accurate.  To add a little more detail, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2011/03/15/ef-4-1-model-amp-database-first-walkthrough.aspx" rel="nofollow">this ADO.Net team blog post</a> explains how to correctly replace the code generation in an EF 4.0 project with EF 4.1.</p>

<p>However, I have a similar issue after upgrading to 4.1 and using DbContext (including some other features) I don't have a .Load() method either.  I think you were in the same place I am <em>before</em> you started (unnecessarily) messing with references.</p>

<p>Check out the link above, let me know if it helps, and if you find a solution for the missing .Load() function be sure and let us know.</p>
