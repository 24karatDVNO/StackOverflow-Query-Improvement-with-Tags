<p>If you blur your image a bit, then you could just move half particule at a time, maybe one fourth only and print them all.. that would cut computation and the user wouldn't see it, getting the feeling all particules move.</p>

<p>But what ever you choose, I think you should be put a strong limit, not all users have powerfull android devices.</p>
