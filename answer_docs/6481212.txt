<p>You probably need to translate the CGRect for rotation. UIView has a number of instance methods for converting rects and points. It accounts for views outside the frame of another view (to find out how far below a UIPopover the keyboard rect is, for example) as well as rotation. c<a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIView_Class/UIView/UIView.html" rel="nofollow">onvertRect:fromView:</a> is just one example, but they all start with 'convert'.</p>
