<p>The only real benefit I can think of is having multiple tables with the same name. That way, you could run a debugging database and a development database with the same tables, but the debugging database has testing information in it, and you can switch over to the development database when it's ready just by changing a single string. You could also use that to perform seamless backups, and many other things. Speed might possibly be improved a bit if you had tons of tables with tons of fields, but probably not by much.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Actually, if the multiple databases span multiple servers, you could store information for fast access (for example, in a forum you might store the latest threads and the user information) on the local server, and store, for example, archived threads on a high-capacity but slower to access server, which would definitely increase speed and decrease the cost of space on the main server.</p>
