<p>I know this is an old question but you might want to take a look at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/closure-templates/" rel="nofollow">Closure-Templates</a>.

<p>If you do decide to look into using them then I'd suggest using <a href="http://plovr.com/" rel="nofollow">plovr</a> for building them.</p>
