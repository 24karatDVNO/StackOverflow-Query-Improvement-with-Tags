<p>Maybe a bit more than you ask for but have you ever looked at <a href="http://build.opensuse.org/" rel="nofollow">http://build.opensuse.org/</a> ? It's a fantastic build service that allows to build packages for a vast number of Linux distributions (including Fedora 10 - however marked as DISCONTINUED).</p>

<p>Apart from using the superb web-interface, you can also build locally (just in case, your package is closed-source?).</p>

<p>And yes, building both 64 bit and 32 bit packages is supported, along with building 32 bit support libraries for 64 bit platforms.</p>
