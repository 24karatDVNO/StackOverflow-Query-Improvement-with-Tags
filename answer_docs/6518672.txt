<p>Well we have got the solution...We are using our own Derived Run class from the Run class and explicitly putting a new whitespace Run. ANd now it is not able to combine the Runs when same properties are applied on them.</p>

<p>This is not a very efficient solution but its fine for the time being.</p>

<p>Thanks </p>
