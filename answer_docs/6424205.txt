<p>You are not using <strong>only</strong> the password for authentication. Technically, another user shoulf not be able to create an account using an already used and cancelled email address, because he is not able to confirm the email address. I would solve the problem by adding a UNIQUE constraint on the email field - that would eliminate your potential problem/s</p>
