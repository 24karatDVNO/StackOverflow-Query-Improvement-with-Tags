<p>I would use an IDE, this avoid the need to</p>

<ul>
<li>setup the path</li>
<li>check that all the classes you need have been compiled.</li>
<li>setup the classpath for the <code>java</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Instead all you need to do is hit the <code>Run</code> button and it does the rest.</p>

<p>It may even help you write/format the code and generate a toString() method, getters/setters  and unit tests for it.</p>
