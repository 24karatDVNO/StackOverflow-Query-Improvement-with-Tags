<p>I've not tested this but it should give you an idea..</p>

<p>Inner join the receipts i.e. subset of the table where left(col,1) = 'r'
with the journals (subset of the table where left(col,1) = 'j) and you'll get a list of matching rows.</p>

<p>Then simply select the rows from the table which are not in this list</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM [Table] 
WHERE SUBSTRING(col,2,100) NOT IN 
    (SELECT Receipts.Ref FROM 
           (SELECT SUBSTRING(col,2,100) Ref from [Table] WHERE LEFT(col,1) = 'R') Receipts
INNER JOIN (SELECT SUBSTRING(col,2,100) Ref from [Table] WHERE LEFT(col,1) = 'J') Journals ON Receipts.Ref = Journals.Ref)
</code></pre>
