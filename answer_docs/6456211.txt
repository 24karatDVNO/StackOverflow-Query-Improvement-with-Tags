<p>There are faster ways, but I won't call them efficient. Things will really soon start to became uncontrollable and the code ugly with many horrific unnedeed bits. Also sooner or later your layout will most likely break.</p>

<p>The best you can do is learn to use html and CSS as their best, making the code as clean and clear as possible.
You should also start making some little pieces of code (snippets) and store them in a safe place, ready to use them as a basic layout structure for every site you make.</p>

<p>You will realize then you only need to accomodate the layout with little adjustements most of the time.</p>
