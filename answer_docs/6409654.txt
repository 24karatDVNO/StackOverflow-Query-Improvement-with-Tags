<p>the problem is that the way you call your console.log(). it evaluates right there and shows found even if nothing is found. because you don't pass a reference to a function, you just call log('found')</p>

<p>you should have </p>

<pre><code>jQuery('div.media', jq).each(function() { console.log("found") });
</code></pre>
