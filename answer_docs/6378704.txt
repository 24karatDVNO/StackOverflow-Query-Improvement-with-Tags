<p>I think technically you don't HAVE a position before it is drawn. I personally don't know of a way to convert the "System.Windows.Forms.FormStartPosition" enumerable to a Point. </p>

<p>However for what you want, it should be quite simple. I would show the first form, then pass it's bounds to the second form where you can set it's start up logic to use those for it's positioning. like so.</p>

<pre><code> public Form1()
    {
        InitializeComponent();

        StartPosition = FormStartPosition.CenterScreen;
        this.Shown += new EventHandler(Form1_Shown);
    }

    void Form1_Shown(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        ShowForm2(this.Bounds);
    }  

    public void ShowForm2(Rectangle ParentBounds)
    {
        Form2 f = new Form2();

        int x = ParentBounds.Right+2;
        int y = ParentBounds.Y + (ParentBounds.Height/2) - (f.Height/2);

        Point childStartPosition = new Point(x,y);

        f.StartPosition = FormStartPosition.Manual;
        f.Location = childStartPosition;
        f.Show();
    }
</code></pre>
