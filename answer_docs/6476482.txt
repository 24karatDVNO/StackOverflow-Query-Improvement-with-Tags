<p>The one thing that is very important to consider when moving to a front end powered architecture, is that in many cases you will need to generate content for search engines. </p>

<p>So ideally your architecture is capable of routing and evaluating templates / views on the server side. I think this ability to use the same logic on client and server side is something that is very lacking at the moment.</p>

<p>It looks like you pretty much have the backend tasks all listed there, but this new architecture does bring further detail into how you need to do these things, so it's not necessarily as easy as it the list makes it seem. </p>
