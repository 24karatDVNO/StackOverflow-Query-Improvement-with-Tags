<p>if your pressed for time, you might have to start with the current hacks. It isn't too tough to get going with it but it also isn't super easy to get started like I'm sure the SDK will be. If you can wait another month or two, i would just wait because spring will be over soon and I'm sure enough people will be asking for a new timeframe or at least a comment on what the plan is from microsoft. i would imagine they will announce something in the next month or two about it.</p>
