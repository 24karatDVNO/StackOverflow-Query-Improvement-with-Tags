<p>The solution is interfaces. Your Table 1 and Table 2 classes should implement an interface (such as ISortableTable or whatever you want to call it) with a property for CurrentValue. Table1's CurrentValue property implementation would return the correct result for Table1 and Table2's CurrentValue property would return the correct result for Table2. Then your sorting function can work with any class that implements the ISortableInterface and work with the respective object's  CurrentValue property.</p>
