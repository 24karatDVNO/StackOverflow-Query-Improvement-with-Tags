<p>What is the url?  Are the tags in the header? Are you able to test switching to their new OG open graph tags?  Facebook has been known to deprecate old functionality with little to no warning - and perhaps the old url's are working still because Facebook has already cached the data. It looks like a lot of <a href="http://forum.developers.facebook.net/viewtopic.php?pid=351744" rel="nofollow">people are having this same issue</a> - and I am assuming Facebook will fix it soon if it isn't already fixed. </p>
