<p>It depends on what you mean by "far".  If you mean in another room, but within Bluetooth range or on the same local network, then there is GameKit.  If you mean on a different network, or a long distance away, then you are looking at needing to have a server that keeps track of the devices and the connections between the devices so you can use Push Notifications.  If you are thinking of something like Words With Friends where it sends a message to another user to tell them it is their go, then you would need the server.</p>
