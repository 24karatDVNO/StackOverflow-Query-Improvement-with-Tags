<p>First thing I would do is install <a href="http://www.appcelerator.com/products/download/" rel="nofollow">Titanium Studio</a> either on top of Aptana or standalone and then start using the <a href="http://developer.appcelerator.com/apidoc/mobile/latest/Titanium.API-module" rel="nofollow">Ti.API</a>.* for you're debugging instead of <code>alerts</code>. Also what exactly are you trying to accomplish. I can't tell from you're question what you are trying to do fully?</p>
