<p>In a well designed database the joins you need in your queries should be pretty easy to code up. The downside is you have verbose SQL. The upsides are enormous:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Consistent easy to update tables.</li>
<li>Quickly change according to business needs. Well designed DBs can usually handle queries that were not even thought of during the original design.</li>
<li>Quickly accommodate new entities. Its relatively easy to add new data entities and attributes to a well designed database. It can be a nightmare incorporating seemingly simple changes to a de-normalised database. </li>
</ul>
