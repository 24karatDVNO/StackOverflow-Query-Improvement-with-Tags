<p>How about a symbolic link? That would solve that issue in a snap, provided you can implement them and control permissions. Not sure how to do that with iOS, but it's definitely worth looking into. When it comes to file sharing, links are your best friend. </p>

<p>I don't have any experience with iPhone app dev, but I've done plenty of file share management in Linux. Hopefully it's not too different... But I have no idea what system calls are available to you with iPhones. If you find out, I'd enjoy knowing. Good luck!</p>
