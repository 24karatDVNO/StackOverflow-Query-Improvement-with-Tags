<p>How data is stored is not a property of the data itself. This is the same for images; you can store the <em>same</em> image at <em>different</em> locations, so it is impossible to return <em>the</em> filename. Instead, you can wrap your image in an <code>LocationBoundImage</code> class or something like that, where you keep a reference to the image and the filename by yourself.</p>
