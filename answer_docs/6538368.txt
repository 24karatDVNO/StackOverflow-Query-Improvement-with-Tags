<p>If I'm understanding the question correctly:  just create a separate data set and use the result set as the available values for your parameter.  Discriminate in your where clause.</p>

<pre><code>-- (example) Query used in the CarMakes dataset
SELECT DISTINCT make
FROM    tbl_Cars
where  make not like 'Toyota',
        and make not like 'Ford'
        and make not like 'Kia'
union select '- Select Make -';  -- used as first value in drop down 
</code></pre>

<p>Then set the data set you create as the available values for your parameter.</p>
