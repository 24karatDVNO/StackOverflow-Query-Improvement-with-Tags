<p>First you should use password hashing in your application, thus the password fields of the database should hold the hashed values.</p>

<p>Assuming this, to accomplish your goals,</p>

<ol>
<li>consider your string username -> Hash it -> write a query to check whether that hashed value and the user's password's hash value stored in the database is the same</li>
<li>consider string password and string newPassword in your code -> Hash both -> check whether the hash values are the same</li>
<li>consider string password and string newPassword -> check whether each is null or the length is 0</li>
</ol>

<p>Also you should perform these tasks in the following order:</p>

<p>1 -> 3 -> 2</p>

<p>Hope this helps...</p>
