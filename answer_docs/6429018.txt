<p>Android 1.5 is one of the oldest versions (if not the oldest), most if not all handsets have 1.6 or greater. I would not recommend breaking your head on this. Also there are very significant differences between 1.5 to 1.6, the API's are a lot more consistent from 1.6. Not the answer you want, but just my two cents.</p>
