<p>Try to make a RSS-view.</p>

<p>(Sorry if I use wrong terminology as I use a Swedish translation of Drupal)</p>

<p>Then make a page and make the urlpath the exact same as for the feed (eg. aggregator/sources/10 for feed nr. 10)</p>

<p>This will replace the default list of rssposts and instead show your custom rss-view without the "show more" links.</p>

<p>This worked for me at least. Let me know if you need more info...</p>
