<p>The datagrid is a tricky one, and pretty complex. I think in this case, I might try altering the "setter" for the property that this is bound to. Throw an exception if the user enters an invalid value. The datagrid supports showing the invalid cells with a validation error (red border) so that the user sees which cells / rows have issues.</p>

<p>It's not ideal, but it might work.</p>
