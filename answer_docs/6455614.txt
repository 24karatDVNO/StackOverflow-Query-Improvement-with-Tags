<p>This may sound a bit random, but I would suggest using <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">maven</a> to control your build and test process. There is a nice plugin for <a href="http://mojo.codehaus.org/selenium-maven-plugin/" rel="nofollow">Selenium</a> in maven that will control the startup/shutdown of the server. Maven will provide you with many other added benefits.</p>
