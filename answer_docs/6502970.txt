<p>Frankly this shouldn't be an issue tbh...</p>

<p>However if it bothers you, you can use jQuery to embed the FB login code once the DOM is ready so that it isn't sent as a part of the markup to the validator</p>

<p>Try something like :</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function() {
     var fbCode = "Your facebook code goes here";
     $("#forgot").prepend(fbCode);
});
</code></pre>
