<p>You could create an <code>ObservableCollection&lt;Customer&gt;</code> and fill it with the customers from the database which you want to show in the View. When you add a new customer then add it to this collection as well as save it into the database. The <code>CustomersView</code> binds on the ObservableCollection and is updated automatically without the need to refresh the data from the database.</p>

<p>The <strong>BookLibrary</strong> sample application of the <strong><a href="http://waf.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow">WPF Application Framework (WAF)</a></strong> shows how this can be done.</p>
