<p>Maybe I'm wrong, but your counter variable will always be 1, since it's been initialized just before the increment operation.</p>

<p>Move its initialization like that:</p>

<pre><code>public class First {
    int counter = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>and let counter = counter + 1 stay where it is now</p>
