<p>The <a href="http://developers.fwix.com/" rel="nofollow">Fwix API</a> is good for your location needs and especially for local news.

There are many good weather APIs available for free, such as the weather underground API, world weather online. <a href="http://www.programmableweb.com/" rel="nofollow">Programmable Web</a> is a good resource for discovering APIs and getting ratings on them.</p>
