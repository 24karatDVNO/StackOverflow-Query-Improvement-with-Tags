<p>datasage you are correct, if you wish to "answer" the question I'll gladly hand over the answer to you. All I needed was to declare the formo() method in my models.</p>

<pre><code>class Model_User extends Model_Auth_User {

    // FOR FORMO
    public function formo()
    {

    }

} // End User Model
</code></pre>
