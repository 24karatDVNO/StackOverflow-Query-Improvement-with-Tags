<p>There is currently no way to do a <code>SELECT *</code> using <code>QueryOver</code>, unfortunately. This has been discussed on the NH Google Group a few times. If you really want something like this, then you can extend <code>QueryOver</code> to iterate over all of the properties you've mapped and build up a projection list under the covers.</p>
