<p>I would strongly recommend making "time" a first class concept in your Payer entity. Damien_the_unbeliever's "temporal table" solution achieves this, but there are alternative implementations. </p>

<p>In the past, I've solved problems like this by adding a validity window to the payer table, and comparing the transaction date to that window. </p>

<pre><code>TRANSACTION 
Id(PK) 
PayerId 
TransactionDate
...

PAYER 
Id 
ValidFrom
ValidUntil
....
</code></pre>

<p>This schema allows you to find out the payer as they were at the time of the transaction; it does mean you can't rely on referential integrity (because ID in the Payer table won't be a valid primary key - there are multiple records with the same ID.</p>

<p>A twist on that would be:</p>

<pre><code>TRANSACTION 
Id(PK) 
PayerId(FK) 
...

PAYER 
Id(PK)

PAYER_DETAIL
ID(FK)
PayerID (FK)
ValidFrom
ValidUntil
.....
</code></pre>
