<p>You could try something like this, so that you can change any/all of the clip settings:</p>

<pre><code>function changeClipTo(t,r,b,l,elementID) {

var clipString = "rect(" + t + "px " + r + "px " + b + "px " + l + "px)";
document.getElementById(elementID).style.clip = clipString;

}
</code></pre>

<p>That way you can have any click event supply your desired values such as onclick="changeClipTo(0,50,10,0,'someElement');" or href="javascript:changeClipTo(0,50,10,0,'someElement');"</p>

<p>If you don't know the dimensions ahead of time, then you could use the onclick/href to call a function which determines the value you need, then call changeClipTo() from that function, passing in the computed value(s).</p>
