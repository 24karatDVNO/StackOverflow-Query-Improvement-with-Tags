<p>How about using git to create a patch from all versions of 1.8. and 1.9 to this new release.
Then you could see which patch makes more 'sense'.</p>

<p>For example, if the patch 'removes' many methods, then it is probably not this release, but one before. If the patch has many sections that don't make sense as a single edit, then it probably isn't this release either.</p>

<p>And so on... In reality, unfortunately, there doesn't exist an algorithm to do this perfectly. I will have to be some heuristic.</p>
