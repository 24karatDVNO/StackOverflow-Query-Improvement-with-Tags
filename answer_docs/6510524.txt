<p>as long as where is executed before select, selected aliases are not known in where clause. you can only use the aliases in order by clause.</p>

<p>you have to write like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM 
(
Select TD.ProductAccumRule_Id,TD.PRODUCT_ID,TD.VARIABLE_ID,TD.Accum_code,Ordinal = row_number() over( partition by TD.PRODUCT_ID,TD.VARIABLE_ID,TD.Accum_code order by TD.PRODUCT_ID,TD.VARIABLE_ID,TD.Accum_code) From testdata TD
Join (
select PRODUCT_ID,VARIABLE_ID,Accum_code from testdata where 
isActive = 1
GROUP BY PRODUCT_ID,VARIABLE_ID,Accum_code
having count(*) &gt; 1
) TEMP on TD.Product_Id = temp.Product_Id and TD.Variable_Id = TEMP.Variable_Id and TD.Accum_code = TEMP.Accum_code
where TD.isActive = 1
) myInnerQuery
where Ordinal  &lt;&gt; 1
</code></pre>
