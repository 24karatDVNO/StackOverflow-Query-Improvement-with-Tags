<p>If you want to integrate it into a web page this is called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_applet" rel="nofollow">Java applet</a> (sorry the <a href="http://java.sun.com/applets/" rel="nofollow">Java applets website</a> seems to be down right now). Otherwise you should maybe look at the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index-jsp-141438.html" rel="nofollow">Java Plug-in Technology page</a>.</p>
