<p>I'd hook the button up to a function that creates your sort descriptor and fetches your results. This results in a fetch being made each time the state is altered.</p>

<p>Pick a default, use this as the default sort type without any user-interaction, and then users can change their preference with the button.</p>

<p>I hope you find this handy!</p>
