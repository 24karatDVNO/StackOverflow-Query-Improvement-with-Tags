<p>If you want to post to another URL, and have the page go to that URL as part of the post, then the only solution is to place your data in input elements inside of a form who's action is the page you wish to post to.  </p>

<p>You can do ajax posts, like you're doing, but that won't redirect the user to that page with the post data.  You are likely making this a lot harder than it has to be.</p>
