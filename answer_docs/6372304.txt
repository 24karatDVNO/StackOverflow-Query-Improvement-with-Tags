<p>I wrote a program to both write to and read from a text file. To write the lines of a list box to a text file I used the following code:</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub txtWriteToTextfile_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles txtWriteToTextfile.Click

    Dim FileWriter As StreamWriter

        FileWriter = New StreamWriter(FileName, False)

        ' 3. Write some sample data to the file.
        For i = 1 To lstNamesList.Items.Count
            FileWriter.Write(lstNamesList.Items(i - 1).ToString)
            FileWriter.Write(Chr(32))
        Next i

        FileWriter.Close()

End Sub
</code></pre>

<p>And to read and write the contents of the text file and write to a multi-line text box (you just need to set the multiple lines property of a text box to <code>true</code>) I used the following code. I also had to do some extra coding to break the individual words from the long string I received from the text file.</p>

<pre><code>Private Sub cmdReadFromTextfile_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles cmdReadFromTextfile.Click
    Dim sStringFromFile As String = ""
    Dim sTextString As String = ""
    Dim iWordStartingPossition As Integer = 0
    Dim iWordEndingPossition As Integer = 0
    Dim iClearedTestLength As Integer = 0

    Dim FileReader As StreamReader


        FileReader = New StreamReader(FileName)

        sStringFromFile = FileReader.ReadToEnd()

        sTextString = sStringFromFile

        txtTextFromFile.Text = ""

        Do Until iClearedTestLength = Len(sTextString)

            iWordEndingPossition = CInt(InStr((Microsoft.VisualBasic.Right(sTextString, Len(sTextString) - iWordStartingPossition)), " "))

            txtTextFromFile.Text = txtTextFromFile.Text &amp; (Microsoft.VisualBasic.Mid(sTextString, iWordStartingPossition + 1, iWordEndingPossition)) &amp; vbCrLf

            iWordStartingPossition = iWordStartingPossition + iWordEndingPossition

            iClearedTestLength = iClearedTestLength + iWordEndingPossition

        Loop

        FileReader.Close()


End Sub
