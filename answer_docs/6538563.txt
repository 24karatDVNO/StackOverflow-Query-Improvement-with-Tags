<p>A suggestion I have is to pre-calculate the change size and store them in an attribute on the file revision.  You can use the undocumented <code>p4 attribute</code> command.</p>

<pre><code>PS&gt; p4 help undoc

    attribute -- Set per-revision attributes on revisions (unsupported)

    p4 attribute [ -e -f -p ] -n name [ -v value ] files...

        Sets a user-managed attribute 'name' to 'value' on opened files.
        If -v isn't given the attribute is cleared (if set).

        Attributes can only be viewed with 'p4 fstat'.

        The -e flag indicates the 'value' is in hex.

        The -f flag sets the attribute on submitted files.

        The -p flag creates an attribute whose value will be propagated
        when the file is opened with 'p4 add', 'p4 edit', or 'p4 delete'.

PS&gt; p4 help undoc

    Unsupported or obsolete Perforce commands and options:
...

    p4 fstat [ -Oacedhiz ] [ -A pattern ]
        The -Oa flag shows attributes set by 'p4 attribute'.  The -Oae flag
        shows the attribute values encoded as hex.  The -Od flag outputs the
        digest of the attribute.  The -Oc flag outputs the path, revision and
        type of the server archive file (requires 'admin' privilege). The
        -Oz flag outputs the path and revision of any lazy copies (requires
        'admin' privilege).  The -Oh flag outputs the size, digest and any
        selected attributes of the synced revision rather than the head
        revision. The -Oi flag outputs extra (debugging) information about
        the attributes.  The -A pattern flag restricts attributes to those
        matching 'pattern'.
