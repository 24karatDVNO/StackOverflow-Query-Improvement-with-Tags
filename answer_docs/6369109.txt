<p>Substract 1 year.
Then substract 1 day until you end up the same day of week you want.</p>

<p>Each year the "days of week" goes back 1 day, except when there is a feb 29th in between, they go back 2 days.</p>

<p>It's because a year is 52 weeks + 1 day (+2 for leap years).</p>

<p>So if you apply this logic indefinitely, you will end up, years after years, having a june 16th at may 24th.</p>

<p>If you don't want that to happen, you have to somewhere memorize the reference year and base your arithmetic on it.</p>

<p>For example, if the "new" monday is 4 days back (because 3 years have passed), you might prefer to chose the monday 3 days ahead in time, so as not to indefinitely substract days, years after years.</p>

<p>Hope it helps.</p>
