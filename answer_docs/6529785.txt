<p>the code you are showing does not mean that external individuals can access files on your server, all that it shows is that a program RUNNING on your server can access files on the server which make sense.</p>

<p>If you want to prevent a program from accessing those files then add security permissions to them for a user that is not the user that runs the program you want to prevent from accessing them.</p>

<p>If you are looking to secure a directory look at using .htaccess (very basic security) or take into account Alex's solution</p>
