<p>Maybe I'm just oversimplifying the question, but it looks to me like all you really need to do is wrap each notecard in a div, perhaps giving each div a <code>&lt;div class="notecard_wrapper"&gt;</code>. then just attach a stylesheet that specifies the width and height you want for each card.</p>
