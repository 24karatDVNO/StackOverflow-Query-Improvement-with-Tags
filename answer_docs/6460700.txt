<p>Fiddler catches requests from the browser, instead of reporting on what the browser is doing, so I don't think that you'll have much success using it for this purpose.  If a visitor has a page which makes no requests open their browser, Fiddler won't see anything.  Similarly, Fiddler won't see new requests when a user switches tabs.  </p>

<p>You might have better success by looking into browser add-ons / extensions.  </p>
