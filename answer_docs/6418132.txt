<p>this may be your solution, I was having the same problem recently. Make sure you are saving as character encoding UTF-8. If you are using OpenOffice (Xcel formats CSV wrong), when you do "Save As" tick the Edit filter settings" and then once you click save you'll be given the option to save as UTF-8. For Xcel just Google it.</p>
