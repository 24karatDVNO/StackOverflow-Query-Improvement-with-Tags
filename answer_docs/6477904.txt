<p>I would rather than Map use arrays, however this might be too big. Try to find out what parts of the matrix would be used for computation, look into some divide and conquer/parallel matrix algorithms, which often decompose matrices in smaller matrices - structurally or using matrix multiplication, eigennumbers and other algebraic properties of matrices. You can than do various things like buffering and caching etc to speed up access to the data on disk.</p>
