<p>I didn't really find a good solution, but I did find a dirty fix. I realised that the <code>.vbproj</code> file--which contains the <code>BuildAction</code> setting, is in XML format. So, I replaced every occurrence of <code>&lt;None ...</code> with <code>&lt;Content ...</code>, and then each <code>&lt;/None&gt;</code> with <code>&lt;/Content&gt;</code>. This wasn't an ideal solution, because it also affected many files that shouldn't have been included in the published version of the website, but it is what it is.</p>

<p>I did learn, however, from KevDog,s <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vsx/thread/bd74f1bc-2c60-4f9c-b29f-e50bf16aadfc/" rel="nofollow">link</a>, that it is possible to write custom file templates for Visual Studio that affect the <code>BuildAction</code> attribute of any new files created with that template. This wasn't appropriate in my case, because it affects only newly generated files, but it might help someone else who sees this problem coming from the beginning of a project--like me, on my next php project.</p>
