<p>Try making this control a <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2006/01/29/436854.aspx" rel="nofollow">CompositeControl</a> instead of inheriting from Repeater.  Inside the composite, instantiate your Repeater, PagedDataSource, button controls, and any other controls necessary and add them to the control tree via overriding CreateChildControls.  You can set up your event handlers at this point, too.  Then, <a href="http://p2p.wrox.com/asp-net-2-0-professional/67647-passing-templates-composite-control.html" rel="nofollow">expose the repeater's templates</a> in the composite.  I am offering this suggestion as a different approach as you are essentially writing a composite control.  However, you're not adding the buttons to one of the templates of the repeater at render time (say the footer), so you may be losing something.</p>
