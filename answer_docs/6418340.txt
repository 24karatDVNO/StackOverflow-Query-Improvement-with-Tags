<p>I never solved this, but I found a work around.. In case anyone else ever runs into this problem, try to just move all your drawing coordinates up: subtract the height of the ad banner (you can get that with the method getHeight()).</p>

<p>The ad banner doesn't load right away though, so you'll have to keep checking for it. I did that in my main game loop.</p>
