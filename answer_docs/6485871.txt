<p>Well if you mostly read data from the structure and insert rarely you could use a trivial sorted array and do a binary search. Can't get much simpler or simpler if you're worried about search performance. Now not that great if you regularly update the structure - then you'll have to use something more complicated.</p>

<p>Also I think - but not totally sure - wouldn't a binary tree work just as well? Search for the position where the correct node should be and use its predecessor if the value isn't found.</p>
