<p>Check out the Android Developers site at <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/resources/index.html</a>.  They have a large number of tutorials and examples to get you started.  Also, most books related to Android development have an app of some sort that they walk you through, highlighting certain aspects of the OS/device and then implementing them in a coherent program.  </p>

<p>Also, the Android SDK includes a number of examples (w/ source code).  I don't have the directory structure in front of me, but I believe the examples for each version of the SDK can be found in their respective directories.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
