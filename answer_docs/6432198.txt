<p>I would use a curve-fitting procedure, but also throw in a constant term, i.e. 0 =<strong>B0</strong> + B1*X + B2*Y + B3*X*Y + B4*X^2 etc.  This would catch the translational variance and then you can do a statistical comparison of the estimated coefficients of the curves formed by the two sets of points as a way of classifying them.  I'm assuming you'll have to do bi-variate interpolation if the data form arbitrary curves in the x-y plane.  </p>
