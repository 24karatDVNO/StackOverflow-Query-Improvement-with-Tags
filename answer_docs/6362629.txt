<p>Self-signed certificates are not and can not be trusted (unless the user explicitly trusts them or some code does this). You indeed need to purchase a certificate from one of established CAs such as Thawte, GlobalSign, Comodo (InstantSSL). We use GlobalSign and Comodo, each has it's own advantages. What you need is a regular "SSL certificate" (as they call it though this name is incorrect) issued for your server's domain name.</p>
