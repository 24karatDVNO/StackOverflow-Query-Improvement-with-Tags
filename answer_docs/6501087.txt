<p>I remember someone at google I/O saying that the HoneyComb emulator will run really really slow due to hardware acceleration turned on. </p>

<p>The PC may use software rendering for OpenGL hence the bad performance. The almost everything you see on the HoneyComb screen is rendered using OpenGL ES. </p>
