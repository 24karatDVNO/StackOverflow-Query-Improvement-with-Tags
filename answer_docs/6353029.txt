<p>I would definitely have a folder (user ID) per user, so you won't have to parse a giant folder of images if you're trying to load one user's images. Beyond that, I think you could just store them in a single folder and use a naming convention or group all images in a sub-folder in a way that makes the retrieval of those images easier.</p>
