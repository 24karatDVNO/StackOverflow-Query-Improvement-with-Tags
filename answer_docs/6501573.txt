<p>I personaly prefer Design2.
My opinion however, is to have a separate table for QuestionType, and have a foreign key in Questions, to reference the particular question type of a question.
Just helps to separate it out a little more.
Secondly, i suppose, i am not a big fan of ENUM sort of types in the database.</p>

<p>Just my initial thoughts.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
