<p>I'm prefer to use an additional column with the moderator_id. In that case you can dynamically change user's set for each moderators without changing anything in the code.</p>

<p>To initially define user's set per moderator use query like that:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE users
SET moderator_id = 1
WHERE user_id BETWEEN 1 AND 50
</code></pre>

<p>To select users by moderator use this query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE moderator_id = 1
</code></pre>
