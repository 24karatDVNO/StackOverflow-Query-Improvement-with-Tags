<p>Just wanted to point out that our product, <a href="http://postageapp.com" rel="nofollow">PostageApp</a>, will allow you to send via the Google SMTP if you are so inclined. All you have to do is add the SMTP details to your project and you're good to go.</p>

<p>I just checked with the personal project I have hooked up with Postage and all the emails sent out appear in the Sent Mail folder.</p>

<p>Let me know if that's what you're looking for, or if you have any other questions!</p>
