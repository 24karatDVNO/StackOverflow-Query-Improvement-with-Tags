<p>You cannot avoid this warning (except by suppressing it). The problem is that Java at runtime is only able to check that the object is of type <code>Collection</code> at runtime when casting. It cannot check that it is of type <code>Collection&lt;Server&gt;</code>. That is what the error means.</p>
