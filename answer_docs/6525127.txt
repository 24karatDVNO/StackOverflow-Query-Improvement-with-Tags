<p>They are very different, but based on your question, I have assumed you are trying to accomplish the same thing with both of them and it seems possible. What you should consider however is that <code>setContentView(R.Layout.main</code>), will un-register previous listeners that were set in that contentView if you moved back and forth, <code>startActivity(intent)</code> would be more preferred if you have listeners active and wanted somewhat an interactive experience. There are other better approaches that would depend on what you are trying to do.</p>
