<p>It's also possible that your file is using a format that's compatible with the <code>csv</code> module, you could also look into that, especially if the format allows quoting, because then <code>line.split</code> would break. If the format doesn't use quoting and it's just delimiters and text, <code>line.split</code> is probably the best.</p>

<p>Also, for the <code>re</code> module, any special characters can be escaped with <code>\</code>, like <code>r'\^'</code>. I'd suggest before jumping to use <code>re</code> to 1) learn how to write regular expressions, 2) first look for a solution to your problem instead of jumping to regular expressions - «Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use regular expressions." Now they have two problems. »</p>
