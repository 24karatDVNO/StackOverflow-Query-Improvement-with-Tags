<p>It turns out that the combination of devise (1.3.4) and <a href="https://github.com/ernie/meta_search" rel="nofollow">meta_search</a> (1.1.0.pre) results in these segmentation faults. Disabling one of them "solves" the problem. The root cause is either in one of these gems or in ruby itself. See <a href="http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/4821" rel="nofollow">this ruby issue</a>.</p>
