<p>The only way would be to use a proxy, or to ask your ISP/hosting provider to give you a new one (and I suspect they probably won't, or if they do, they won't do it too often.)</p>

<p>If a site is blocking your IP address because you're running a spider on it, you should maybe think about how often you go to that website and how much traffic you cause the site. There's a reason they're blocking your IP (if they are.) Maybe change how often you go to the side with the spider, and also determine whether or not you should be (though I don't have any details on the site, so I can't comment on that)</p>
