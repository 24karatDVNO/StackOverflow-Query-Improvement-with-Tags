<p>I believe that <code>getElementsByTagName</code> can only be applied to an element node, but the result of <code>getElementsByClassName</code> is surely going to be a <em>list</em> of nodes. You'll either have to pick one (<code>[0]</code>?) or iterate over the collection (make sure it's not empty!).</p>
