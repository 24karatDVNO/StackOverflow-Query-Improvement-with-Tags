<p><a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/mysql-init.html" rel="nofollow">mysql_init</a> allocates new object which is freed when you close the connection. You will have to clean up the memory in case your code flow doesn't go the place where you close the connection.</p>

<p>So i would say call mysql_close once you are done using the connection handle.</p>
