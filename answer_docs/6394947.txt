I've now tried to copy your scenario into a new .feature file and it works perfectly. So I now think (even more) that there is something hidden messing up your feature. 
The rest of my answer still holds though. </p>

<p>But I would recomend that you dont use implementation names such as mGrpId. Rather use the name of that group and look it up. Remember that you want your end users, testers, analysists etc to be able to read the scenarios. </p>

<p>Change into that and maybe your obscure error goes away as well ;)  </p>
