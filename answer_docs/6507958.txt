<p>All I needed was a gender.Trim() to get rid of all white spaces. </p>

<pre><code>var gender = value.ToString();
        try
        {
            return gender.Trim() == "F" ? "../Resources/Icons/male_user.png" : "../Resources/Icons/female_user.png";
        }
        catch (Exception)
        {
            return "";
        }
</code></pre>

<p>Thats took care of it all, and it works. Thanks for the answers and "doh!" possibilites though.</p>
