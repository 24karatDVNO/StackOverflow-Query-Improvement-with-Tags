<p>Have you tried placing Flash/ActionscriptProject.html in a subdomain? (To get this to work, you'll need to modify your hosts file). That often helps with async loading operations. </p>

<p>What if you put that script tag from the loaded html at the bottom of the body or have it called after a very brief delay? This way, the HTML will load and it will be considered "loaded" by FF and IE7.</p>
