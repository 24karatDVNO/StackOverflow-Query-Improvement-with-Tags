<p>If the library is LGPL, you shouldn't need to license it under LGPL. If it is GPL, then you probably would, unless you use child processes for something like ffmpeg.</p>

<p>AGPL/GPL does not affect if your work is "derived"; GPL requires you to distribute source code if you distribute the binary, AGPL requires you to distribute source code if you use it over a network.</p>
