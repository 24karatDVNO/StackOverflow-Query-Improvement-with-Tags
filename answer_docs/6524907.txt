<p>I'm not sure I fully understand the situation you're asking about, but the simplest way to get data from server to client is to request the data from the client and have the server return a JSON formatted block of data (often an array or object).  Since JSON is just javascript, the client can do a JSON-safe eval on the returned data and instantly have a javascript data structure that represents all the data.  Depending upon what library you are using on client/server, there are usually JSON helper functions built-in to the library to make both ends even easier (though writing the code from scratch is easy too).</p>
