<p>I tried on Oracle but the idea is here : </p>

<pre><code>with t1 as (select 1 id,'AAA' col from dual union all
            select 2,   'BBB'     from dual union all
            select 3,   'CCC'     from dual ),
     t2 as (select 1 id,'BBB' col from dual union all
            select 2,   'CCC'     from dual union all
            select 3,   'DDD'     from dual )
---
SELECT t1.col col1, t2.col col2
  FROM t1, t2
 WHERE (t1.id = t2.id OR t1.col = t2.col)
   AND (t2.id = 1 OR t1.col = t2.col)
</code></pre>

<p>results :</p>

<pre><code>COL1 COL2
---  ---
AAA  BBB
BBB  BBB
CCC  CCC
</code></pre>
