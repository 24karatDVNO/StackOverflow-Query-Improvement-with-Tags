<p>Following your interface convention:</p>

<pre><code>interface Conditional {
    public Condition Condition();
    public int TrueValue();
    public int FalseValue();
}
</code></pre>

<p>I would use classes and instead of referring to ints, I would refer to an <code>Expression</code> class too.</p>
