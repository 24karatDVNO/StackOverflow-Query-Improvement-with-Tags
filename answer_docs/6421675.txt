<p>I did this:</p>

<pre><code>var Product = Backbone.Model.extend({});
var Products = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Product,
  url: '/rest/product'
});
var products = new Products();
var first = new Product({id:1});
first.collection = products;
first.fetch();
</code></pre>

<p>This has the advantage of working when you're not using a REST storage engine (instead, using something like the HTML5 Local storage, or so forth)</p>
