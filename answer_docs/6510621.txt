<p>class files are the binary output of the java compiler. they are the java equivalent of <code>.o</code> files in C or C++ the "meat" in this instance is probably for you to implement.</p>

<p>The java compiler handles finding and including the necessary files, you may need to <code>import some.package.name.*;</code> to avoid having to use full class names (e.g. <code>SomeClass</code> instead of <code>some.package.name.SomeClass</code>)</p>
