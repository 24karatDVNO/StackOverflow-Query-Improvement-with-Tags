<p>John K's comment is a good solution. If you're loading the other page synchronously (ie full page load, not AJAX) then obviously you're going to have to maintain the state between pages. The very nature of HTTP is pretty stateless, so a query-string is a nice simple solution for persisting data such as a background colour.</p>
