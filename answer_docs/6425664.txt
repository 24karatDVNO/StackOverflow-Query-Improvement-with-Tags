<p>The first URL is either handled by something like mod_rewrite or a Java servlet (which can be mapped to any path), or it is simply a directory index. Most any web server will allow you to place a page with a given (often configurable) name in a directory, such as index.html or index.php, and have that page load by default. So, for example, www.mysite.com/ actually loads www.mysite.com/index.html. This works on subdirectories as well.</p>
