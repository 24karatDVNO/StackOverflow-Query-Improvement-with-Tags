<p>I did not understand the context but it seems to me that a good reverse of the object library could be a good start. You can get class and sequence diagram showing static architecture or methods interactions. You can also revers more than one library which is really useful if you need to understand what is going on.
Having said that I found an example of Jar reverse engineering at: <a href="http://www.ejb3.org/jar_file_reverse/jar_file_reverse.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ejb3.org/jar_file_reverse/jar_file_reverse.html</a></p>

<p>You should certainly have other tools providing this kind of reverse but I don't know about them providing such an advanced feature therefore can not help further.</p>
