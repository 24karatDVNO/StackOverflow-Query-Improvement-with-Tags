<p>I used Maxy-B's solution. My code, in particular, is a bit different so I thought to post it for posterity:</p>

<h3>~/.vim/after/syntax/yaml.vim</h3>

<pre><code>let b:current_syntax = ''
unlet b:current_syntax
syntax include @HTML syntax/html.vim

syntax region htmlCode start=#^html:#hs=e+1 end=+^\w+he=s-1,me=s-1
    \ contains=@HTML

let b:current_syntax = ''
unlet b:current_syntax
syntax include @TEX syntax/tex.vim

syntax region texCode start=#^tex:#hs=e+1 end=+^\w+he=s-1,me=s-1
    \ contains=@TEX
</code></pre>

<p>This highlights the top-level YAML nodes <code>html</code> and <code>tex</code> with those respective types of code. It's not very dynamic, but it suits my purpose and this may serve as helpful guideline for someone doing something similar. It'll highlight the following as expected (or at least, as I expect it), for example:</p>

<pre><code>regular:  # yaml
   - yaml # yaml
html: 
    &lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt; # html
tex:
    \begin{document} # tex
    \end{document} # tex
the-end: may be necessary # yaml
</code></pre>
