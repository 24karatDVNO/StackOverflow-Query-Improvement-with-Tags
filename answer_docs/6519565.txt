<p>You could always chunk the lines up? I mean why open one file and iterate all the way through when you can open the same file 6 times and iterate through.
e.g.</p>

<pre><code>a #is the first 1024 bytes
b #is the next 1024
#etcetc
f #is the last 1024 bytes
</code></pre>

<p>Each file handle running in a separate process and we start to cook on gas. Just remember to deal with line endings properly.</p>
