<p>You're on the right track. You want to subclass NSView. From there you can either implement the -(void)drawRect method to do your own custom drawing, or you can add subviews, or both.</p>

<pre><code>//add some subviews
NSTextField * textField = [[[NSTextField alloc] initWithFrame:self.bounds] autorelease];
[self addSubview:textField];


NSButton * button = ...
[self addSubview:button];
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use the Interface Builder (now built in to XCode 4) to design the widget, and then hook up the parts with code.</p>
