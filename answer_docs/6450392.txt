<p>In Scott Meyers "More Effective C++" Book he makes a very rational case for preferring prefix increment to postfix increment.  In a nutshell, in that language due to operator overloading facilities prefix increment is almost always faster.  Objective C doesn't support overloaded operators but if you have or ever will do any C++ or Objective-C++ programming then preferring prefix increment is a good habit to get into.</p>

<p>Remember that most of the time ++n looks like:</p>

<pre>
n = n + 1
[do something with n]
</pre>

<p>Whereas n++ looks like (if used as intended):</p>

<pre>
register A = n;  // copy n
[do something with n]
n = A + 1;
</pre>

<p>As you can see the postfix case has more instructions.  In simple for loops most compilers are smart enough to avoid the copy if it's obvious that the pre-increment n isn't going to be used but that case devolves to the prefix case.</p>

<p>I Hope this makes sense.  In summary you should use prefix unless you really want the "side-effect" behavior of evaluate then increment that you get from the postfix version.</p>
