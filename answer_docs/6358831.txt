<p>My first thought was something much cruder than filtering. Why not look for the big drops followed by long enough stable periods?</p>

<pre><code>span.b &lt;- 20
threshold.b &lt;- 0.2
dy.b &lt;- c(rep(NA, span.b), diff(y, lag = span.b))
span.f &lt;- 10
threshold.f &lt;- 0.05
dy.f &lt;- c(diff(y, lag = span.f), rep(NA, span.f))
down &lt;- which(dy.b &lt; -1 * threshold.b &amp; abs(dy.f) &lt; threshold.f)
abline(v = down)
</code></pre>

<p>The plot shows that it's not perfect, but it doesn't discard the outliers (I guess it depends on your take on the data). </p>
