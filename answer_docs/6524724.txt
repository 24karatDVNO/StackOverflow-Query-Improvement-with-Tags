<p>You can use glob-style patterns in <code>if</code> conditionals in bash:</p>

<pre><code>if [[ $string != *"@"* ]] ; then
    echo You have entered an invalid e-mail address!
    exit 1
else
    # do something
fi
</code></pre>

<p>I'd go a step further and require at least one character at either side of the <code>@</code>:</p>

<pre><code>if [[ $string != *?"@"?* ]] ; then
    echo You have entered an invalid e-mail address!
    exit 1
else
    : # do something
fi
</code></pre>
