<p>No it's no problem to change it. A few steps to follow.</p>

<p>Go into your WordPress admin panel and update the site url and blog url  to point to your new location. Then click save.</p>

<p>Rename the folder from wordpress to en</p>

<p>Finally you may have some problems with images, if so you will need to replace the old urls in your database. Personally I would import the database, run a find and replace and then re-import the sql script.</p>

<p>Here is another solution though that runs a query on the database and will also work. <a href="http://www.master-script.com/moving-wordpress-site-to-new-domain.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.master-script.com/moving-wordpress-site-to-new-domain.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong> if you are going to run the find and replace on the database anyway the first step is irrelevant as it will be changed also.</p>
