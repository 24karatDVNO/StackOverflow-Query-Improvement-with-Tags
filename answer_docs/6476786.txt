<p>In my opinion, if you build complex and dedicated for android app service the most suitable language is java - this same language as your app, this same knowledge, this same tools.
As far as I remember PHP was very poor language, easy to write something like "hello world" but very annoying  when you want to write something more complex. On the other side you should take a look at costs of writing and deploying your service. PHP developers are far cheaper than Java EE developers, one month of Java hosting costs similar to one year PHP hosting with MySQL installed. This is really big advantage to PHP.</p>
