<p>Creates annonymous function and calls it, therefore avoiding pollution of the namespace and memory for functions that are called only once.</p>

<p>Although similar to:</p>

<pre><code>var f = function () { ... };
f();
</code></pre>

<p>This variant avoids creating a variable f, which saves memory and avoids namespace conflicts.</p>
