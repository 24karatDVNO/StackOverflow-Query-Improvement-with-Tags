<p>It is indeed possible to re-partition a flash drive.  If you are already running Linux, you should be able to delete the existing partition table and create a new one using <code>fdisk</code>.  I have done this on several occasions, although I have never tried it on a drive that large.</p>

<p>You can read more about partitioning with <code>fdisk</code> <a href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Partition/fdisk_partitioning.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.  Remember that you have to run <code>fdisk</code> on the raw device (not on a partition), and that you must unmount any filesystems on the drive prior to re-partitioning it.  For example, you would use <code>fdisk /dev/sdb</code>, not <code>fdisk /dev/sdb1</code>.  Once you're created your partitions, you can <a href="http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-format-create-linux-filesystem/" rel="nofollow">create a filesystem using <code>mkfs</code></a> and then mount them with <code>mount</code>. </p>

<p>One warning, though.  Windows will treat the flash drive as if it has a single partition (I believe it only sees the first one).  Linux will see all partitions.  I'm not sure how Chromium would handle this, but be aware that different OSes may not support it.</p>
