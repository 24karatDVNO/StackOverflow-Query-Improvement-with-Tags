<p>well found out this is a bug (Bug 6519647) in metalink. the workaround is pretty much use something different!</p>

<p>(this bug persists no matter how the proxy is set (with/wihtout the "http." and even via the proxy class)</p>

<p>sorry for the duplicate edit/answer, this is my first 'answer' to my own question.</p>

<p>switched over the ftp4j but still running into squid proxy issues (which is a whole different story).</p>
