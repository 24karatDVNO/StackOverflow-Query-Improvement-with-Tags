<p>When using a LinearLayout make sure that the orientation is set the way you want. The default orientation for LinearLayout is horizontal, so I suspect that your CheckBox is to the right of your ListView, outside the screen, where you cannot see it. Try explicitly setting the orientation to vertical. But do it in XML as CommonsWare suggests</p>
