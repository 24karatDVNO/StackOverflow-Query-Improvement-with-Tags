<p>Another "More Dynamic" way is to write a library in Managed C++ that can be injected. </p>

<p>A managed C++ library can export native functions to use for loading it into another process.</p>

<p>Only write some code in that Managed C++ library that allows you to load extra libraries. </p>

<p>That library can be re-used to inject future objects...</p>
