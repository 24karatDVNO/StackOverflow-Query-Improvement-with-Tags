<p>I have many different versions of Eclipse and related products installed. So I have them installed as <code>C:\Eclipse\...</code> for Windows and <code>/Eclipse/...</code> under Mac and Linux. Usually with the directory name as the base name of the zip - e.g. <code>eclipse-rcp-helios-SR2-macosx-cocoa-x86_64</code>... Some products, like those from IBM, have their own ideas and can often not be changed...</p>

<p>As for the workspaces - yes, I have one for each customer - they are placed under <code>/Eclipse/Workspaces/...</code> and friends.</p>

<p>And the target platforms are placed under <code>/Eclipse/TargetPlatforms/...</code> and friends.</p>
