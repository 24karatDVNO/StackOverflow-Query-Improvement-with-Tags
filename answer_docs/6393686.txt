<p>Basically what the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/b0kk5few.aspx" rel="nofollow">do ... while</a> loop here does is keeps repeating its self as long as the choice is 1 or 2.</p>

<p>After the 'do', the user is prompted to enter their choice, 1 2 or 3. If they choose 1 or 2, their respective function is called. Then the loop repeats. If they choose 3, the loop does not repeat so the program ends.</p>

<p>Hope this helped!</p>
