<p>You mean to send through WCF and not "to WCF", you can serialize any object to be sent in networking applications and de-serialize it on the other end to regroup its contents into the original object. This way you don't need to loop, send the whole list (serialized) and on the other end you do the specific operation on each item alone.</p>
