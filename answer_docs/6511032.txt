<p>From what I believe, your UI validations and Logic validations should not be mixed up. It is worth doing in over again in the Logic even if it is the same thing. Basically, it is not the responsibility of the Entity object to carry the validations. It might be some service layer class that does it for the Entity. And you can probably throw an exception at that point.So it is handled in completely different ways in the UI and the Logic. </p>
