<p>It is always good to use SQL VIEWS instead of using sub queries. Because VIEW will be having already compiled result.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW subqueryView 
    SELECT age, count(*) AS total 
    FROM pacient
    WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 40 
    GROUP BY age ORDER BY age

SELECT A.age, A.total, MAX(A.total) as max_value FROM (SELECT FROM subqueryView) as A
GROUP BY A.age, A.total
</code></pre>
