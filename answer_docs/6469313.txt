<p>Ok guys, I solved this problem already partly thanks to Jano as well.</p>

<p>So this is what I did.</p>

<ol>
<li>Uninstalled all existing Xcode 3 SDKs</li>
<li>Reinstall MAC OS X</li>
<li>Update MAC OS X to 10.6.7</li>
<li>Install Xcode 4 in the default folder (Developer)</li>
</ol>

<p>And it is solved! The weird experiment I tried again was to install Xcode 3.2.6 only to find the same 16 errors on the libxml2.2.dylib. So Xcode 4 works, Xcode 3 failed. Therefore, time to get use to Xcode 4!</p>
