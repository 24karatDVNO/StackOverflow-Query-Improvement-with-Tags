<p>When you launch a popup, give it a variable name:</p>

<pre><code>myWin = window.open(etc)

//in the child window, call window.opener.myFocusFunction()
//in the parent window, use this...

function myFocusFunction(){
   myWin.focus();
   //myWin.blur();
   //uncomment as needed!
}
</code></pre>

<p>Have a play, it works for me.</p>
