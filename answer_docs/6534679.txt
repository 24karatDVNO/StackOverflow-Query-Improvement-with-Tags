<p>I would suggest downgrading to 3.0.0 and then looking at this issue to solve the problem you will get: <a href="https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/issues/376" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/facebook/php-sdk/issues/376</a></p>

<p>I did the same as you upgrade from 2.x to 3.0.0 and thankfully this was the only issue.</p>

<p>I definitely won't be upgrading to 3.0.1, there are too many issues.</p>

<p>The guy ptarjan has a habit of closing issues without fully investigating them and doesn't always get to the heart of the bugs.  It's working for me and won't upgrade.</p>

<p>Edit: There is even an issue about this, do you check github issues? :</p>
