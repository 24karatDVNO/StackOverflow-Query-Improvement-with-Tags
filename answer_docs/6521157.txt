<p><strong><code>this</code> is a reference to the current object</strong></p>

<p>You can use <code>this</code> to refer to any current instance and any instance of its super class.</p>

<p><strong>If your class extends Activity</strong>. It is a case of inheritance. your class is subclass and Activity class is parent class. then you can use this keyword to get instance of Activity
 beacause Activity class is super class of your class. This is <strong><em>implicit casting</em></strong></p>

<p>also Activity class <code>Context</code> as superclass. so you can refer the instance of that class using this keyword.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
