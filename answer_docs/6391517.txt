<p>An NSNetService instance is scheduled on the RunLoop so that it can regularly publish the Bonjour service via the mDNSResponder and that other devices on the network keep being informed the service exists.</p>

<p>Simply remove the NetService from your RunLoop should do the trick. Don't forget to call -stop before, in case your NetService is currently trying to publish.</p>
