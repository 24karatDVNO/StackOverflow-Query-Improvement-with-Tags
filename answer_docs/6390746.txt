<p>Thanks all for replying.</p>

<p>For now I am taking all the products in an array. I the given product is not group product the array will contain only one product &amp; if the given product is group product, the array will contain all the sub products for that group product. And then will navigate through array to generate a from which will ask for the attributes of all product in array...</p>

<p>But still I would like to do some R&amp;D with Eval() when the time permits...</p>

<p>Thanks again,
Ekta..</p>
