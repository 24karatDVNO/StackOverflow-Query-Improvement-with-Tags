<p>Thanks everybody, I'm sure now that it is a host problem, not a problem on my end - even though I've tried it on several hosts - I think it's pretty common for http post to be limited to around 25MB.</p>

<p>I have now set my uploader to take a maximum file size of 20MB, that should make it pretty safe on most hosts.</p>
