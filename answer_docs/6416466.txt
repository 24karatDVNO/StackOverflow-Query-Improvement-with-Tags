<p>As Brandon suggested, posting to the second view was a usable solution.
Something along the lines of:</p>

<pre><code>def view2(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        page_list=request.POST.values()
    else:
        HttpResponseRedirect('/urls/')
</code></pre>

<p>and then no need for regex in the urls</p>
