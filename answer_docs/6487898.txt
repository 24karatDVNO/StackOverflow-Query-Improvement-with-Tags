<p>A possible merging function is available in the standard library. It's intended to merge sorted lists to make sorted combined lists; garbage in, garbage out, but it does have the desired property of maintaining sublist order no matter what.</p>

<pre><code>def merge_files(output, *inputs):
    # all parameters are opened files with appropriate modes.
    from heapq import merge
    for line in heapq.merge(*(reversed(tuple(input)) for input in inputs)):
        output.write(line)
</code></pre>
