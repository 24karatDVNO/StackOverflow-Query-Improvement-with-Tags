<p>Maps store by Key:Value pairs. In your code when you do </p>

<pre><code>childRowMap.put("startDate","startDate"+x)
</code></pre>

<p>it is doing this:</p>

<pre><code>childRowMap.put(Key,Value)
</code></pre>

<p>So basically you are setting the key startDate to be equal to startDate0 (when x is 0). When you loop through the second time, you are setting the key startDate to be equal to startDate1 (because x is 1). Now whenever you look up startDate, it will only have startDate1 stored because startDate0 was overwritten because you only have 1 Map.</p>

<p>You can fix this by either reinitializing your Map every time you loop through or by using new and unique Key's to each Value you put in the Map.</p>
