<p>You've several issues imho. One is that you're going to end up with a seq scan no matter what you do.</p>

<p>But I think your more crucial issue here is that you've an unnecessary join:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT profile.* FROM TempResult
WHERE 
     (RowNum &gt;= @FirstRow)
     AND 
     (RowNum &lt;= @LastRow)
</code></pre>
