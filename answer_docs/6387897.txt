<p>I do not know ruby well enough to give you code but I came across a similar problem with uploadify and C#.  In FF and Chrome (I presume Safari as well) the current session is not sent back by uploadify (it is in IE and everything works ok).  The recommended way around this is to post your session id as part of the uploadify data and then pull the session manually in Ruby.</p>

<p>Depending what you are doing with the session there may be security concerns, but from your description it shouldnt be a problem.</p>
