<p>To do this, you MUST..</p>

<p>1) make sure that .net 4.0 is installed (not by default on most machines yet)</p>

<p>2) extract and register the DLL (you need to call regasm.exe on the extracted DLL)</p>

<p>This is a lot to do just to "GetDiskDriveInformation" as the very first step of the install.</p>

<p>It is far better to get the information natively in Inno or call a native DLL that doesn't have the prerequisites.</p>
