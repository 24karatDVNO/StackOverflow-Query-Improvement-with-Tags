<p>My mistake... I was copying paths of an existing SVG that had a VIEWBOX defined... so I thought my paths were absolute values, but in fact they were very different than what I saw in my svg-editor (Inkscape).  In Raphael you don't have to define a viewbox at all, so this is were it went wrong.</p>
