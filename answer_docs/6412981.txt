<p>If you are installing a SQL Server database onto the users machine then they will need to have an edition of SQL Server running on their machine. If your database contains only things that are in the SQL Server Express edition then that will be sufficient. If not, then they will need the appropriate edition installed on their machine.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if these are stand-alone applications installed onto end user's machines then you may want to look at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/compact.aspx" rel="nofollow">SQL Server Compact</a> instead as that may fit your needs better. (SQL Server is designed for multi-user multi-machine access with the Express edition used mostly by hobbiests and in RAD scenarios)</p>
