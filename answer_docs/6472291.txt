<p>As others have mentioned - use IIS Express OR what you can do is install the version of IIS that would normally be on the system. Check out using WiX for installs and items such as this:</p>

<p>You may be able to find someone on the WiX mailing list that has done just this already.</p>

<p>Note - WiX was written by some Microsoft folks and was actually going to be the installer in VS 2010 but was changed unfortunately.</p>
