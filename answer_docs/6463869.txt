<p>AFAIK, php is fired after the post, and before the chunk encoding.  The only way I know how to do it, is install an output handler thats above the chunking.  I've only been able to do such things through either a C module, or mod_perl, since it allows you to install handlers at any point of the request.  I had a similar problem with trying to allow large uploads, because php never fires until after the post is done.  So there is no way to check "is it a logged in user" or "allow only this script to get large post data".</p>
