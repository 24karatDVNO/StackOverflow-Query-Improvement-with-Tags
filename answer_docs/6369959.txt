<p>I dont think it should be in quotes. By, putting it within quotes, you are telling the compiler that it is a string. If it is PHP it should be like 
<code>$array = array("Dog" =&gt; array("leg"=&gt;4, "eyes" =&gt; 2),"Cat" =&gt; array("leg"=&gt;3, "eyes" =&gt; 4));</code></p>

<p>Or is it like you have a string and want to convert the data in it into string???</p>
