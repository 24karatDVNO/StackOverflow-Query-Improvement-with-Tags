<p>Your text view is being scaled as pixels. It's like zooming in on an image in photoshop: the pixels are enlarged so it doesn't get any sharper. I would recommend making the view's frame larger, and at the same time increasing the font size. Not sure if you can animate them together smoothly, but the end result should be what you want. Perhaps as you scale it up (as you're doing now) you can cross-fade it with a larger-text version that starts scaled down.</p>
