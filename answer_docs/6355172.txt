<p>There are many different ways. To start off, I would recommend you download the data using JSON or RSS. Once you download it, you can either use Core Data, SQLite or Plists. </p>

<p>I would recommend Core Data over SQLite. So basically it's Core Data vs. Plists. Now if you want to run complex queries, use Core Data. If all you want to do is store simple data, in forms of arrays/dictionaries (can also be nested), then go for Plists.</p>
