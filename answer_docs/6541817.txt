<p>I would suggest not giving the splash window any taskbar button.  When your app gets activated (with event Application.Current.Activated) you can do this:
1) Make the splash window visible
2) Make the splash window topmost (temporarily)
3) Wait for a short time (a few milliseconds)
4) Make the splash window non-topmost
This will make the splash window pop in front of all other windows on activation.</p>

<p>When your app gets deactivated (with events Application.Current.Deactivated or Application.Curent.Exit), make the splash window hidden.</p>

<p>I think that should give you the behavior you are looking for.</p>
