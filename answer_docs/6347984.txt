<p>I think you would need to check the $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERRER'] to see where they came from. Although, some browsers do not have the referrer, and this can't be reliable.</p>

<pre><code>$url = $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERRER'];

if ($url = www.url1.com){

print(img src="images/url1.png )

}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: HTTP_HOST. (from guy below me)</p>
