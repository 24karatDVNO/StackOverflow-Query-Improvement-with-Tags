<p>Some basic principle</p>

<ol>
<li><p>make your code as small as possible. </p></li>
<li><p>Do not depend on library like Jquery. It would make conflict on third party's site easily.</p></li>
<li><p>make your script load asynchronous</p></li>
<li><p>leave some interface so others can do sth. custom setting upon your code.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not add too many global variables. Try to use namespace to write your code.</p></li>
