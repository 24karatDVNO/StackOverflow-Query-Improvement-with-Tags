<p>ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) exists with the sole responsibility of managing top-level domain name systems and IP addresses</p>

<p>a translation system needs to be created that allows multiple scripts to be converted to the right address. ICANN is also to decide on the degree of freedom given on global top-level domain names.

If this changes companies and individuals can have unlimited choices such .indian / .delhi or maybe an anshul.jain</p>
