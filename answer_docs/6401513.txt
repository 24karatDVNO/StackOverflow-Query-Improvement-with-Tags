<p>Instead of testing in the loop whether you are processing the first image or not, process the first image separately. Including a test condition in a loop which effectively can only be fulfilled in only one iteration seems like a misconception to me.</p>

<p>Put the logic of resizing the image into its own function to make code-reuse easier.</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if($stmt-&gt;rowCount() != 0) {
    // this gets the first row
    $row = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);

    // take the first $filename result and resize it to make it larger
    resizeImage($row['id'], $row['filename'], 'large');

    // we always want to create a thumbnail, hence do-while
    do {       
        // resize $filename into thumbnails and output 10 thumbnails 
        resizeImage($row['id'], $row['filename'], 'thumbnail');
    } while ($row = $stmt-&gt;fetch(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC)) {
}

function resizeImage(id, name, type) {
    // whatever here
}
</code></pre>
