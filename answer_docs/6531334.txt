<p>You could override the back button and only let the activity finish if the 'conditions have been met'.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onBackPressed() {
    if(conditionIsMet) {
         //The condition was met, close the activity
         finish;
    } else  { 
         //Cancel the button press
         return;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I hope this is the answer you were looking for, but your question wasn't too clear.</p>
