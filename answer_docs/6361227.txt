<p>An HTML5 page, using the storage API, can use local storage to save data in any format but this does not, nor should it, interact directly with the client's host file system.  The only mechanisms that I have found to read files from the host file system is to use a file input control.  In order to do what you are asking, this will have to be handled as a download and must require user intervention.  </p>
