<p>I had a similar situation. After a bit of experimentation I realised that that best approach was to upgrade my old Rails app to Rails 3 on Ruby 1.9.2.</p>

<p>This means you don't have to deal with different versions (although I use RVM and it is awesome).</p>

<p>The problem is that Rails has changed a bit in the jump from 2 to 3 and I had to learn a bit about new stuff in Rails and Ruby. In the end though I think this was the right approach because I now know how Rails 3 apps work and my old app is using the latest version.</p>
