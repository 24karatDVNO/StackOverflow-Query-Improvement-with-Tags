<p>An EAR file is just a zip file. Rename it to .zip and you can view it in WinZip or whatever.<br>
Then if you are lucky you can decompile the file and make any mods you need to the file (I say lucky because it depends how the file was compiled, obfuscated or without any debug info).<br>
Use ANT to rebuild the EAR (See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1267300/how-do-i-create-an-ear-file-with-an-ant-build-including-certain-files">How do I create an EAR file with an ant build including certain files?</a> or some other resource)<br>
You should be good to go, just redeploy the new EAR.</p>
