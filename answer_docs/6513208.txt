<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4270321/can-linq-be-used-to-find-gaps-in-a-sorted-list">This question</a> shows how you can get a single gap, but I can't think of how to get a list of gaps without a loop of some kind...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.musahafalir.com/2010/08/18/finding-gaps-inside-a-datetime-interval/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Here is an article</a> where you can get a generic method, that does this, but it uses loops.</p>

<p>Sorry I couldn't give you a cool LINQ query to do it, but at least other people stumbling across this question may get some answers in the above links.</p>
