<p>I feel like you are asking the wrong question. From the user's perspective, iOS doesn't have a filesystem or folders or files or save buttons. Sure, you <em>could</em> create a view that looks like a folder with files in it... but you shouldn't. </p>

<p>My recommendation is that you rethink your design and accomplish what you need to do by using the new iOS paradigms instead of trying to replicate the old desktop paradigms.</p>
