<p>Out of the box, .NET provides a hefty library of security algorithms that conform to standard cryptography.  Check out the documentation on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9eat8fht.aspx" rel="nofollow">System.Security.Cryptography</a> and choose the algorithm that best suits you.</p>

<p>The Convert class has static methods to convert strings <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.convert.tobase64string.aspx" rel="nofollow">to</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.convert.frombase64string%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">from</a> Base64, so there again, you have no problems in .NET as far as you're concerned.</p>

<p>I think you're covered pretty good.  Just be sure that you choose something that you're comfortable with.  And understand that when you choose a hashing algorithm, you're not going to be able to "unhash" the output, only compare.</p>
