<p>What you need to use the  <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ListView.html#addHeaderView%28android.view.View,%20java.lang.Object,%20boolean%29" rel="nofollow">addHeaderView</a> of <code>ListView</code>.</p>

<p><strong>According to the documentation</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Add a fixed view to appear at the top
  of the list. If addHeaderView is
  called more than once, the views will
  appear in the order they were added.
  Views added using this call can take
  focus if they want. NOTE: Call this
  before calling setAdapter. This is so
  ListView can wrap the supplied cursor
  with one that will also account for
  header and footer views.</p>
