<p>Adobe is actually consistently pumping out new documentation, tutorials, and examples of Adobe AIR for iOS, Android, and BlackBerry Playbook development.</p>

<p>Also, I think what he meant was Flash CS5.5, not CS5.</p>

<p>Here are some links that might help:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>Ultimately, you're developing with Adobe AIR and targeting specific, newly-available-for-targetting platforms and devices.
