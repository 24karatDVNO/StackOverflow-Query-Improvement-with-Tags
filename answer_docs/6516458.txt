<p>first think you need to understand is each UIObject has tag value. for example if you declare a button means by default it has property named tag value. for the number 1 you set 1 means using this tag you can access the value. </p>

<p><code>{
nslog(@"%d",sender.tag);
TheFunctionIWantToDeclare(sender.tag);
}</code></p>
