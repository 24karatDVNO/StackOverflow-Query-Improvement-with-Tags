<p>Equivalent of what you showed  is:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM table1 tb1
WHERE EXISTS
(
    SELECT *
    FROM table1 tb2
    WHERE 
        tb1.col1 = tb2.col1 and 
        tb1.col2 = tb2.col2 and
        tb2.col3 &lt; 4
)
</code></pre>

<p>However, this query does not make much sense as it is equivalent of</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM table1 tb1
WHERE tb2.col3 &lt; 4
</code></pre>

<p>I just assume that the example you show is not well thought out.</p>
