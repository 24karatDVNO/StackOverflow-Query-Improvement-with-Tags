<p>I find that imaginary numbers can sometimes help convey coupled information quite well while reducing clutter. My method will double the number of calculations necessary (i.e. I find the distance X and Y then Y and X), and I still need a single for loop</p>

<pre><code>x = 1:20;
y = 1:20;
[X,Y] = meshgrid(x,y);
Z =X + Y*i;
z = Z(:);
leng = length(z);
store = zeros(leng);
for looper = 1:(leng-1) 
    dummyz = circshift(z,looper);
    store(:,looper+1) = z - dummyz;
end
final = abs(store);
</code></pre>
