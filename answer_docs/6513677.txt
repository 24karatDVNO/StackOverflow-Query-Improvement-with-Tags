<p>You can easily get the img src using <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.simplexmliterator.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.simplexmliterator.php</a> as stated earlier; however, retrieving that specific line of text from the feed seems finicky. There doesn't appear to be any unique identifier to that "description".</p>
