<p>Rather than removing the elements from the form, why not hide them in a "rollup section"? Wrap sections of the form in a div (or fieldset) then use Element.hide/Element.show (or even rollup/rolldown animations from scriptaculous). You can preset the form with some of these less used sections already hidden using Element.hide in a dom:loaded event handler. The important point is not to disable form fields (or remove them) then the validator should see the entire form and work.</p>

<p>This is a technique I've used on a rather complex web-app (Using my own generator/populator/validator/submitter library), it reduces code complexity because all the form is always there, and the users found the rollup/rolldown idea quite easy to get to grips with. It even works on iPhone and Android!</p>
