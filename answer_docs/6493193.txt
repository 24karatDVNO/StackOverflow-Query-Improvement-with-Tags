<p>Whatever you want to access, first you need to have a communication to that device. So my advice is use the TCP/IP protocol to communicate, i.e. The socket programming is needed on both side PC and device to communicate. Then parse the data according to the strategy you follow to send over network. Make the standard to communicate like have some command with specific argument to perform some specific task and the size, interval, order of the arguments.
So with the help of that structure of communication you can execute the operations on both side. 
For example, to get the contact list of phone on device, First query the device and convert the contacts list in a object list format and send over network. Then using the reverse coding of the data packet into objects, display the contacts list on the remote device.</p>
