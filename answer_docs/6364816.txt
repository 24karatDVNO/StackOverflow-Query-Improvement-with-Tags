<p>Could you change the CSS of your framework? So that 15 containers have a "display:none" set and the other one has manually set height and width to fill their space? You hack around have some jquery call *.hide() on the unneeded parts.</p>

<p>In this way your first td is the only one with flash, and contains some code to hide the other tds.</p>
