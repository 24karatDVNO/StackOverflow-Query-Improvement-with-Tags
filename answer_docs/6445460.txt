<p>In addition to setting TabStop to True, make sure the TabIndex is set to a number that is exactly the order of how many tabs you want the user to hit before arriving at the text box. </p>

<p>A TextBox with a TabIndex of value 3 means that the user has to press the TAB key 3 times before activating the focus on the TextBox. In your case, the TabIndex might be 1000 or a negative value.</p>
