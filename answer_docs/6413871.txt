<p>I had the exact same issue until I created a new android virtual device.</p>

<p>Make sure that you create a virtual android device that also has the Google APIs in it also.. just having the APIs in the SDK and setting the run target to a version with Google APIs included isn't enough, you also need to make sure your emulator virtual device has the Google APIs from the Android SDK installed as well.    </p>
