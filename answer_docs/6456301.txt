<p>Unless you use the Fullname a lot, I would suggest to use an anonymous type in your select. </p>

<p>This also limits the amount of data that will be done in your select and other overhead.</p>

<pre><code>var ddlclientnames = (from ddl in mortgageentity.Clients 
                select new { id = ..., FullName = FirstName + Lastname}.ToList();
</code></pre>
