<p>If passing line at <code>alert</code>, newresult.highlighting should be object or array. then, this is not a problem about Same Origin Policy. And you are specifying <code>json.wrf=?</code> for callback.
Probably, you missed about struct of element in highlighting array. maybe.
Try to access directry, and confirm structure of the array.
You are expecting:</p>

<pre><code>{
"highlighting": [ { "description" : "foo" }, { "description" : "bar" } ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it may be</p>

<pre><code>{
"highlighting": { "A001" : { "description" : "foo" }, "A002" : { "description" : "bar" } }
}
</code></pre>
