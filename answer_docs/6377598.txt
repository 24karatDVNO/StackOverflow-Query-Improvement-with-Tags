<p>First, use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/BluetoothChat/index.html" rel="nofollow">BluetoothChat</a> example to start with as coding with Bluetooth is pretty complex and it's nice to have working code.  What you want to look at is handleMessage() in BluetoothChat.java, and you'll need to save off the state.  When the state changes from BluetoothChatService.STATE_CONNECTED to BluetoothChatService.STATE_NONE, the device has become disconnected.</p>
