<p>Which letters?</p>

<p>Depending on the answer to this, it may suffice to generate a normal random number, then convert it to <em>n</em>-base, where <em>n</em> is 10 + the number of letters you want to use.</p>

<p>E.g. with hexadecimal (16-base), you get the letters <code>A</code> to <code>F</code> on top of the digits. Using 36-base, you get all letters of the English alphabet.</p>
