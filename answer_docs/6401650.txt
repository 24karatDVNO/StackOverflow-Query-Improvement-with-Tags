<p>You need to use a custom <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MapKit/Reference/MKAnnotationView_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">MKAnnotationView</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use the MKAnnotationView class
  as is or subclass it to provide custom
  behavior as needed. The image property
  of the class lets you set the
  appearance of the annotation view
  without subclassing directly. You
  might also create custom subclasses as
  a convenience and use them to put the
  annotation view in a known state. For
  example, the MKPinAnnotationView
  subclass initializes the contents of
  the annotation view to a pin image.</p>
