<p>Hi I'm not sure if it can be achieved through scopes in ruby it may be sth like </p>

<pre><code>   shipments = Shipments.all( :include =&gt; :manifests )
   empty_shipments = shipments.select { |item| item.manifests.blank? }
   non_empty_shipments = shipments - empty_shipments
   non_empty_shipments.delete_if {|item| (item.t_start..item.t_end).cover? Time.now}
   empty_shipments &amp; non_empty_shipments
</code></pre>
