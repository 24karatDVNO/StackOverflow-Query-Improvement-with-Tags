<p>Here's pseudocode for a different approach which I've used in SQL:</p>

<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1607336/c-calculate-difference-between-two-dates-number-of-days">Find the total number of days between the two dates</a><br>
Subtract number of weekends<br>
Remove a day if the start date is a sunday<br>
Remove a day if the start date is a saturday<br>
Remove any other days you don't want (see my comment above for how to do this in c#)</p>
