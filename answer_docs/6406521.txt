<p>I found the solution.  The problem was that in loadScrollViewWithPage I was adding the ViewController to the UIScrollView and then modifying the ViewController.  By moving the addition of the ViewController to the end of loadScrollViewWithPage after I had finished modifying the controller the problem disappeared.
    So I moved the following line to the end of loadScrollViewWithPage:</p>

<pre><code>         [self.scrollView addSubview:controller.view];
</code></pre>
