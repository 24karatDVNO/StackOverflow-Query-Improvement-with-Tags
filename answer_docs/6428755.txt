<p>You might not need a document management app.  Users can go directly to <a href="http://svnserver/repository/trunk/project_a/doc1.doc" rel="nofollow">http://svnserver/repository/trunk/project_a/doc1.doc</a> or what have you.  The windows file open dialog can browse the repository as well.</p>

<p>I use Subversion but for sharing some documents and being able to edit the same document simultaneously I prefer google docs.</p>
