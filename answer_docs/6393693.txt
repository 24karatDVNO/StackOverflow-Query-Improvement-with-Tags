<p>I found that serialization was being interrupted because of some problems with some types that were used in the workflow.</p>

<p>The first problem was that I had marked a property with [DataMember] that didn't have a set accessor. NetDataContractSerializer wasn't able to serialize that type until I removed the attribute.</p>
