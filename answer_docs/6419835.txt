<p>I just wanna add that I've created my own .net (JavaNNS) File Parser in Java. It is possible to parse single hidden layer networks. If anyone needs the code who run into the same problem I had before I am happy to share my code.</p>

<p>You can contact me on my blog. Here is the post about the Neural Network Project I've done. Just let a comment there and I will provide you the JavaNNS Parser and the corresponding NeuralNetwork Class.</p>
