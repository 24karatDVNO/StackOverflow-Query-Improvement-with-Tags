<p>The solution was simple in the end. I just didn't understand the concept of getter and setter methods. </p>

<p>So the answer was to make a method in the 'glass' object like so:</p>

<pre><code>-(BOOL)collidesWithRect:(CGRect)rect
{
   return (CGRectIntersectsRect(self.frame, rect));
}
</code></pre>

<p>And then call it from the 'rock' object:</p>

<pre><code>if([rock collidesWithRect:glass.frame])
{
    //collision code
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which returns true when the two rectangles intersect.</p>

<p>I'm surprised I didn't get any replies for this as it was simple solution in the end. Perhaps I didn't explain myself properly? Hope I explained the solution correctly. If not then please feel free to correct me. We wouldn't want the blind leading the blind now would we!!!</p>
