<p>First, make sure that you have the HoptoadNotifier source somewhere in your rails app directory. So, let's assume within your directory you have this:</p>

<pre><code>/railsapp/vendor/plugins/hoptoad_notifier/lib
</code></pre>

<p>which would be where the HoptoadNotifier source is stored.</p>

<p>Then run the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>cd /railsapp
ctags -R --tag-relative=yes
</code></pre>

<p>That will create a file within railsapp/ called tags and will contain the tag info of the HoptoadNotifier module.</p>

<p>I know that appears to be more or less what you have already done, so I can only assume that the HoptoadNotifier source isn't within your directory structure, because I recreated this on my machine and it worked perfectly. You can also run ctags with a "-V" to spit out all the debug info and what it's doing.</p>
