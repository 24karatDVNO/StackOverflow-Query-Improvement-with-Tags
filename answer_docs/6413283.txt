<p>OK. thanks to the two guys that posted suggestions ... I have found a work around, not exactly what I was after, but it has satisfied the particular user concerned. It is as follows:</p>

<p>It has been discovered that the “Search” functionality is linked (for some reason) to the “Cube Models”, A “Report Model” needs to be generated from the cube/sql source within the Report manager (e.g. <a href="http://ServerName/ReportServerName/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://ServerName/ReportServerName/</a>) </p>

<p>Then in RB2.0 (or RB3.0) create a new data source connection</p>

<p>Then “Add Dataset” on the data source created, choose “Query Designer”, then desired perspective, then the “Search” function will be available.</p>
