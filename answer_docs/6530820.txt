<p>That's how you can simply do it in shell. You should write it in script yourself.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; text = '''this is sentence 1. and that is sentence
              2. and sometimes sentences are good.
              when that's sentence 4, there's a good reason. and that's 
              sentence 5.'''
&gt;&gt;&gt; for line in text.split('.'):
...     if 'and' in line:
...         print line
... 
 and that is sentence 2
 and sometimes sentences are good
 and that's sentence 5
</code></pre>

<p>Here I splitted <code>text</code> with <code>.split('.')</code> and iterated, then controlled with word <code>and</code> and if it contains, printed it.</p>

<p>You should also consider that this is <strong>case-sensitive</strong>. You should consider many things on your solution, such as things ending with <code>!</code> and <code>?</code> are also sentences (but sometimes they aren't)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a sentence (ha?) or do you think (!) so?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>is going to be splitted as</p>

<ul>
<li>This is a sentence (ha</li>
<li>) or do you think (</li>
<li>) so</li>
</ul>
