<p>Loop through the array and group invoices by email:</p>

<pre><code>$invoicesByEmail = array();

foreach($invoices as $invoice) {
  if(!isset($invoicesByEmail[$invoice['Email']])) {
    $invoicesByEmail[$invoice['Email']] = array();
  }

  $invoicesByEmail[$invoice['Email']][] = $invoice;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then, it's a matter of looping through the grouped invoice and mailing them.</p>

<pre><code>foreach($invoicesByEmail as $recipient =&gt; $invoices) {
  $emailBody = '';

  foreach($invoices as $invoice) {
    // Parse your invoice
  }

  Mailer::send($recipient, $emailBody, $headers);
}
</code></pre>
