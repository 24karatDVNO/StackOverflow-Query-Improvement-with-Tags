<p>Be careful with "bundle update"! When you ran it, bundler ignored the previously installed gems in Gemfile.lock and updated many or all of your gems. I suggest you revert your  Gemfile and Gemfile.lock back to before you did the update and try bundle install again. Note the gem with the conflict and then do "bundle update gem_name". This should update only the gem with the problem.</p>
