<p>Using PHP's strtotime() is surely a nice way of doing this but I've found issues working with strtotime() earlier. So perhaps you may like to do this only in MySQL, like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT STR_TO_DATE(
    CONCAT(
        SUBSTRING('Fri Jul 16 16:55:52 +0000 2010', 1, 20),
        ' ',
        SUBSTRING('Fri Jul 16 16:55:52 +0000 2010', -4)
    ),
'%a %b %d %H:%i:%s %Y');
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that when doing so I've ignored the +0000 part of the time-stamp.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
