<p>Sure, the first one is the way to go for it:</p>

<pre><code>Table   -&gt; Roles 
Columns -&gt; Id
           Name
           isDownload
           isShare
           isView
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>is a simple design</li>
<li>you can read roles and privileges from the same table without needing JOINs</li>
<li>has lesser space requirements than the second alternative</li>
</ul>

<p>However if you have dynamic privileges with privileges added or removed frequently, you might think of approach 2. But otherwise keeping a single table is fine.</p>
