<p>yes, it is called global. it is some weird pseudo global construct build by VSTO.
it makes for simple looking code like this ;</p>

<pre><code>    Excel . Application eA = Globals . ThisAddIn . Application;
    Excel . Workbook nWB=Globals . ThisAddIn . Application . ActiveWorkbook;
    Excel . Worksheet eS = eA . ActiveSheet;
</code></pre>
