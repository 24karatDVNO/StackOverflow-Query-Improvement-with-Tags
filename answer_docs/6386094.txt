<p>Object-relational DBMS do. They allow to design classes (e.g. CLR types in MS SQL Server) and use them as generic types. So you can make list, array, dictionary or whatever in your class. But generally you don't because there are sets in RDBMS which are called <em>tables</em>. Incapsulating a set of values into one value is usually not good for performance, because you cannot use relational operations (provided by SQL) on it. 1NF is tricky, because it is not always clear which is considered as a single value or as a set of values. It mostly depends on how you process your data.</p>
