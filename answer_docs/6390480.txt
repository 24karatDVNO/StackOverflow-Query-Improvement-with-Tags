<p>To simply output the files after they have been merged you can use:</p>

<pre><code>chdir("./files/");
print join(array_map("file_get_contents",
                     array("1.html", "2.html", "3.html", "4.html")));
</code></pre>

<p>I guess you didn't mean a static list though. To have a complete directory <code>/files</code> read you can adapt this to:</p>

<pre><code>print join(array_map("file_get_contents", glob("files/*.html")));
</code></pre>

<p>If your question was really about creating a new file from the combined contents, then replace the <code>print</code> with <code>file_put_contents(..., "5.html")</code> for example.</p>
