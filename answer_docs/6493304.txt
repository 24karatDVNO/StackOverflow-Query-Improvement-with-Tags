<p>Tasks like that always boil down to a large amount of custom string-munching code. Your best weapons of choice will be regular expressions. Forget about fgetcsv if files look like your file does.</p>

<p>The basic logic might look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fetch all rows of the file via the file function.</li>
<li>Save each table area to an own array containing the rows:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>foreach ($filelines as $line)
{
    $lefreportlines[] = trim(substr($line, 0, 93));
    $middlereportlines[] = trim(substr($line, 67, 135));
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>When you're done, start processing each report as it deserves. For example, the leftmost report might simply be parsed with preg_split('/\s+/', $line);</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, you'll have a lot of work to do. Good luck!</p>
