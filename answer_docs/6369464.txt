<p>There are two aproaches if I understood you correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Repaint only the elements you need, each element must have a boolean indicating if it will be painted or not.</p></li>
<li><p>In case you need to erase exactly one part of the window, use glScissor.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Info:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Now for something new. A wonderful GL command called glScissor(x,y,w,h). What this command does is creates almost what you would call a window. When GL_SCISSOR_TEST is enabled, the only portion of the screen that you can alter is the portion inside the scissor window.</p>
