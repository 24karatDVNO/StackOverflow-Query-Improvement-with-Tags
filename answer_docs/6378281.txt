<p>So totally complicated custom cell comes with a totally ridiculous solution.  I built a view for the cell that has the one field...and another UITableView.</p>

<p>That second UITableView has the "Beginning of the field" text, and its cell gets the background, and I hide the background of the main cell.</p>

<p>I had to play around with the nested table's size and position to get the row to display properly, and make sure that the lines in the background don't shift when it hits the nested table, but it came out perfect</p>
