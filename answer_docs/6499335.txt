<p>Solr offers a wide variety of querying and indexing options. So fields that contain keywords with spaces in it, can be made possible by defining a custom type in the configuration file (see <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrPlugins" rel="nofollow">here</a>). Queries with spaced keywords in it can be made possible by specifying a custom QueryParser. (see <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrQuerySyntax" rel="nofollow">here</a>)</p>

<p>Solr itself doesn't offer a QueryStringBuilder in an API. Actually, Solr itself doesn't offer any API classes at all, since all interaction is done by posting messages over Http. There are client libraries for Java, .NET and PHP etc. In the SolrNet api there exists a SolrMultipleCriteriaQuery, which is quite similar to the CompassQueryStringBuilder.</p>
