<p>Local changes to files on pc 2 should not be lost on an <code>svn update</code>.  They will be merged with changes made on pc1 and committed.  If changes are made to the same lines in conflict, you will be unable to commit until the conflict is resolved, choosing to keep the changes from either of the file versions.  You should not lose local changes after updating though.</p>
