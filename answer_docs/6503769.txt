<p>I ran through the tree recursively and sorted all children of nodes matching <code>schema|wsdl:binding|wsdl:portType|wsdl:types|wsdl:definitions</code>. I used <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/139076/how-to-pretty-print-xml-from-java/139426#139426">this answer</a> for pretty-printing the output. For whatever reason <code>format.setLineWidth(65);</code> doesn't work, so I had to join the lines using <code>replaceAll("\\s*\n\\s*(?=[^\\s&lt;])", " ")</code>. It seems to work fine.</p>
