<p>Definitely it's a compression issue. as a workaround which I didn't try but I think it should work, change the extension of your generated file to something that Gzip will avoid (ex: mp3) and try your test again and see if it get compressed again or not.</p>

<p>let me know what happened, thanks.</p>
