<p>The conditions in the <code>where</code> clause are always enforced as written, so you either need to added the null-test logic or move the filter conditions for the outer join to a sub-query.  Personally, I'd rewrite your query like so:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT   DISTINCT (watcheditems.id)
  FROM              globalitems
         INNER JOIN watcheditems
                 ON watcheditems.aid = globalitems.aid
         LEFT JOIN  (SELECT   bidgroupid
                       FROM   bidgroups
                      WHERE   bidgroups.bidgroupqty &gt; 0) bg
                 ON bg.bidgroupid = watcheditems.bidgroupid
 WHERE   watcheditems.processrunning = 0
</code></pre>

<p>The other change I made was to move your inner join into the <code>from</code> clause. Generally, it's a better practice to use the SQL99 standard of putting the joins in the <code>from</code> clause, but whichever method you choose to use, you should be consistent.  Putting joins in both the <code>where</code> clause and the <code>from</code> clause is just going to lead to confusion.</p>
