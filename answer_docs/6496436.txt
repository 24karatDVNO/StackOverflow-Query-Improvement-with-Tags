<p>As for now I am satisfied with this code because it works fine and gens a random code</p>

<pre><code>DECLARE @code VARCHAR(MAX)
SET @code=(SELECT NEWID() AS GUID)
INSERT INTO TABLEA(CODE)
VALUES(@code)
</code></pre>

<p>But still I hope to get it working as a function. Maybe a little bit later then :)</p>
