<p>I had this problem in a project started in XCode 3 and now compiled in XCode 4, where the line</p>

<pre><code> -#include &lt;Foundation/NSString.h&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>was flagged as no such file.  I fixed it by re-adding the framework - although it was already appearing in my project (from when I had added it in XCode 3) using this approach:</p>

<p>I noticed the list seen by using this method <em>did not</em> include the Foundation framework.</p>
