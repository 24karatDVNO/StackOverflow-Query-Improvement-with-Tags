<p>Even among tablet devices the difference in screen size and screen resolution can require different fonts size and link spacing, for legibility of the font and the accurate touchability of the links. Pages that render on the 10" iPad legibly may be difficult to read and clumsy to use on a 7" tablet. The 7" tablet might make you feel as though you had fingers like Shrek. This just happened to me recently when I used a 7" tablet to look at a site that I'd modified to work well on the iPad. Too tiny to read on the 7" tablet, and you don't always want your 7" tablet users to be pinch-zooming just so they can read your page and interact with it. You must determine the size of the target screen and employ appropriate CSS styling for that form-factor, and you may also be required to reduce the amount of content and/or to provide alternate mode of navigation for the smaller and smallest form-factors. Dynamically-served form-factor-specific content may be required, or highly granular control of content visibility using CSS.</p>

<p>I'd start with pages that have an "airy" look -- avoiding pages that have too much content and are too "busy".</p>
