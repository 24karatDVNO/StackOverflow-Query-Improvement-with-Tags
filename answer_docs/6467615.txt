<p>You could essentially rewrite C++ in C, to whichever level of detail you need. You could start with making the linked list's data type a <code>struct *</code> to some wrapper structure which itself could contain a type identifier and a void pointer to the actual data. You could write your own vtable to allow for polymorphism, and you could add reference counting and memory management... none of that is magic, so if you really need that sort of generality, you could certainly write it all in C. Or just use C++ :-)</p>
