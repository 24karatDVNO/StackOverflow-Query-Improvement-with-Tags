<p>I'm using "Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable" in Win 7 64 bit without any issue. Try to install 64 bit version of "Access Database Engine". </p>

<p>I've got the following configuration
Win 7 64 bit
VS 2010 32 bit (there is no 64 bit)
Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redistributable 64 bit</p>

<p>Cheers...</p>
