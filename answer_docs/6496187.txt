<p>I'm afraid, in such scenarios, we might require some documents and other details from your end in order to investigate the issue; we might also need to log the issues and then follow up, in such cases. And this is something we can do via our own support forums. </p>

<p>You may contact our support team via <a href="http://www.aspose.com/community/forums/aspose.words-product-family/75/showforum.aspx" rel="nofollow">Aspose.Words forum</a> and discuss this matter in detail. </p>

<p>Disclosure: I work as developer evangelist at Aspose.</p>
