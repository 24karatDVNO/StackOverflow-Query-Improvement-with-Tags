<p>Simple answer is to increase the version numbers as you make changes. Don't keep the EXE and DLL in sync because there is no reason for them to be. The DLL is intended to be portable - any EXE could theoretically use it. If you already have a version number for the DLL, then use that as your current baseline and as you modify it, increase the version number as needed.</p>
