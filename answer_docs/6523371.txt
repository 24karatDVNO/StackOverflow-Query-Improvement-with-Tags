<p>When you talk about data information in computer science, you always have to calculate the result by a power of two. See what wikipedia says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"In computing, a binary prefix is a
  specifier or mnemonic that is
  prepended to the units of digital
  information, the bit and the byte, to
  indicate multiplication by a power of
  2. In practice the powers used are multiples of 10, so the prefixes
  denote powers of 1024 = 2^10."</p>

<p>Sometimes people use to round it as you have mentioned, but it is a bad use of it.</p>
