<p>The problem was that <code>ant</code> was installed from Debian repo, while the rest of the java packages: such as jdk, jre, jboss, etc. from other vendors (Sun/Oracle, Apache, etc.)</p>

<p>I've removed Debian-shipped ant and replaced it with the latest binaries from Apache.  This solved my problem.</p>
