<p>Just went through the same thing myself and didn't find good options for KDE.</p>

<p>However! Here are some other options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>There are two Chrome Browser extensions</p>

<ol>
<li>XV (my favorite) found here: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eeocglpgjdpaefaedpblffpeebgmgddk" rel="nofollow">XV at chrome app store</a>. It has a pre-collapsed source view (configurable depth), as well as an outline view and XPath query feature.</li>
<li>myXMLia found here: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/igmlklkcpaicipgblfckillahieebimf" rel="nofollow">myXMLia at chrome app store</a>.  It has a nice XML grid view like I guess some high-end viewers have.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>There is also a windows tool (with out-dated debian package from 2008), whose windows version runs fine under wine.  It includes a pre-collapsed source view, an XPath query feature, an XML diff tool, and a nice XSLT transformation tool, which is pretty cool.</p>

<ul>
<li>Found here: <a href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/xmltreenav/" rel="nofollow">xmlTreeNav</a></li>
</ul></li>
