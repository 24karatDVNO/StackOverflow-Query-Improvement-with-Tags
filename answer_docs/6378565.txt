<p>To have support for a feature that the "internal AST walker" doesn't have.</p>

<p>For example, there are several ways to trasnverse a "hierarchical" or "tre" structure,
like "walk thru the leafs first", or "walk thru the branches first".</p>

<p>Or if the nodes siblings have a sort index, and you want to "walk" / "visit" them decremantally by their index, instead of incrementally.</p>

<p>If the AST class or structure you have only works with one method, you may want to use another method using your custom "walker" / "visitor".</p>
