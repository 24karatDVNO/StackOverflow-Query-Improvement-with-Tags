<p>Running Java on your iDevice is soooo much more complicated than it may initially seem.  True, iOS is simply a different UI on top of the OS X operating system.  However, it's compiled for a completely different instruction set with likely a number of changes made due to the hardware requirements.  So, for starters, getting the JVM binaries running on your iDevice would be nontrivial (would require you to recompile them for the appropriate processor) and would require significant modification to the UI components to work with the screen resolution and drawing paradigms of iOS.</p>

<p>In short, this is a much more complicated process than it seems.  Let me put it this way, you'd have a much easier time writing a compiler that translates Java bytecode to native iOS code than you would trying to get a JVM up and running on it....</p>
