<p>I have never seen it try to auto-convert data types like you are saying it does.<br/>
But in anycase you are not type casting your parameter and you are not declaring a return type.<br/>
Being a constructor it needs to return void.<br/>
You are also not declaring the scope of the variable name/<br/>
Also you are not declaring the package</p>

<pre><code>package{
  public class SomeClass{
      public var name:String;
      public function SomeClass(n:String):void{
          this.name = n;
      }
  }
}
</code></pre>
