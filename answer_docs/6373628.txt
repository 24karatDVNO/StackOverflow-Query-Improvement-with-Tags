<p>Try the following link:

<p>From what I have tried, the setting still exist but not exposed as it used to be. It can still be set using the Settings.System.putInt(...) just specify the name "vibrate_in_silent".</p>

<p>I guess that someday this will no longer work so I recommend protecting your code in any way possible (check if setting exist by calling getInt first, add try-catch...)</p>
