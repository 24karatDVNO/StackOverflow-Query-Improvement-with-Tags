<p>By your data and your desired output, I think you simply want this:</p>

<pre><code>select ID, Year, SUM(Revenue)
from YourTable
GROUP BY ID, Year
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>Now, if your first data sample is already a <code>SELECT</code> query, you need to:</p>

<pre><code>select ID, Year, SUM(Revenue)
from (SELECT...) YourSelect
GROUP BY ID, Year
</code></pre>
