<p>I suggest taking a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlconvert.aspx" rel="nofollow">XMLConvert</a> class. You can use it to encode and Decode XML to make it safe.  This will also handle illegal characters as defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets" rel="nofollow">XML Spec.</a>  Removing characters changes the underlying data and it is better to encode and decode them.</p>
