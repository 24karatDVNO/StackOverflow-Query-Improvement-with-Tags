<p>Check if your "pages" section in web.config looks like: </p>

<pre><code>&lt;pages validateRequest="false" ...&gt;...&lt;/pages&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>if not try to add validateRequest attribute. It works for me cause I had the same problem few months ago. </p>

<p>edit: lol, I didn't see that it is so old post. but I leave my answear, cause maybe it helps someone else</p>
