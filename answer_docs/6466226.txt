<p>Assuming that your entries are directly from a database and therefore are unique for one property, I can think of following steps for a simple solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>Merge Arrays together (<strong>prop1</strong>, <strong>prop2</strong>, <strong>prop3</strong> > <strong>temp</strong>)</li>
<li>Count occurrences for each element (in this example code <strong>tempCount</strong>)</li>
<li><p>Based on the knowledge about the occurrences, create the final array (here called <strong>result</strong>)</p>

<pre><code>Dim prop1() As Variant
Dim prop2() As Variant
Dim prop3() As Variant
Dim temp() As Variant
Dim tempCount() As Integer
Dim result() As Variant

ReDim temp(UBound(prop1) + UBound(prop2) + UBound(prop3) + 1)

'merge arrays
Dim i As Integer
On Error Resume Next
    For i = 0 To UBound(temp)
    temp(i * 3) = prop1(i)
    temp(i * 3 + 1) = prop2(i)
    temp(i * 3 + 2) = prop3(i)
Next i

'count occurences
ReDim tempCount(UBound(temp) + 1)
Dim j As Integer
For i = 0 To UBound(temp)
tempCount(i) = 1
For j = 0 To i - 1

'comparison of elements
    If temp(i) = temp(j) Then
    tempCount(i) = tempCount(i) + 1
    End If
Next j
Next i

ReDim result(UBound(temp) + 1)

'if an element occurs 3 times, add it to result
Dim count As Integer
count = 0
For i = 0 To UBound(tempCount)
    If tempCount(i) = 3 Then
        result(count) = temp(i)
        count = count + 1
    End If
Next i
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>To check for some samples I added this to the code. It simply prints out the arrays <strong>temp</strong>, <strong>result</strong> and <strong>tempCount</strong> to the columns A, B and C.</p>

<pre><code>'some sample arrays
prop1 = Array("a", "b", "c", "d", "e")
prop2 = Array("b", "c", "f")
prop3 = Array("b", "c", "d", "g")

'some sample Output

'temp
Cells(1, 1).Value = "temp:"
For i = 0 To UBound(temp)
    Cells(i + 2, 1).Value = temp(i)
Next i

'result
Cells(1, 2).Value = "result:"
For i = 0 To UBound(result)
    Cells(i + 2, 2).Value = result(i)
Next i

'count:
Cells(1, 3).Value = "count:"
For i = 0 To UBound(tempCount)
    Cells(i + 2, 3).Value = tempCount(i)
Next i
</code></pre>

<p>Notes: <strong>tempCount</strong> just holds the <em>cumulative number</em> of occurrences at the point the element is watched at.</p>
