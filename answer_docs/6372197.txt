<p>I've found the built-in UISplitViewController to behave badly when trying to combine it with most of the other built-in view controller subclasses. Matt Gemmell's <a href="http://mattgemmell.com/2010/07/31/mgsplitviewcontroller-for-ipad" rel="nofollow">MGSplitViewController</a> is a lot more flexible and has worked pretty well for me, despite the odd glitches (though those are at least fixable as the source code is provided).</p>
