<p>This is a good place to employ an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29" rel="nofollow"><em>ed script.</em></a></p>

<p>Something like:</p>

<pre><code>for i in *.java; do
  ed $i &lt;&lt; \eof
1,20d
0r newlicense.txt
w
q
eof
done
</code></pre>

<p>It's probably a good idea to wrap this in such a way that it checks for the old license. You could make it conditional on a grep for a line in the old license, or perhaps change <code>1,20d</code> to something like <code>/first old line/;/last old line/d</code></p>
