<p>I would continue to pass the data to the client side and create the html. I've just started playing around with <a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/" rel="nofollow">jQuery templates</a> and so far they are awesome. Since it is obviously going to be a little slower creating the elements on the client side why not just create and/or load them as needed. The user can only see so much at a time so why make them wait for something they may never see.</p>
