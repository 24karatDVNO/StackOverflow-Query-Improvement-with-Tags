<p>I would try to change the table view content size:</p>

<pre><code>[textView setContentSize:CGSizeMake(width, height)];
</code></pre>

<p>Set width and height so that the whole text view fits inside that text view.
Also check that the scroll is enabled inside of the text view; if it is not then set it:</p>

<pre><code>textView.scrollEnabled = YES;
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it helps! ;D</p>
