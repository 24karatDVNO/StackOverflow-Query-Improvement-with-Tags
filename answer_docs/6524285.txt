<p>Could we see more code? This seems like it should work, so I can see why you're puzzled. Could be a syntactical error in your markup. Maybe try something like this, unless you have a specific reason for the <code>live()</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$('object').click(function() {
    alert('Fired!');
});
</code></pre>
