<p>To answer the last part of your question: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So to just do coding in PHP on linux platform what level of book I should read?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read any beginning PHP book. Whether you are writing your code on a Windows or Linux OS, the end result is the same, a .php file. When you load a page in your browser, the PHP file gets interpreted and compiled by the PHP server. The file that it produces then gets rendered by your browser. So whether you are running firefox on windows, or linux, it really doesnt matter. I hope this clears up some of your confusion.</p>

<p>If you are a beginner, I would suggest you do some experimenting on a server that is already set-up for you, as configuring and installing one on Linux can be confusing at first. Try some simple scripts etc etc, and pick up a book on beginning linux.</p>
