<p>Be sure you are running the most recent version of Thinking Sphinx, 3.0.4 or so. Looks like there has been some issues with <code>sanitize_sql</code></p>

<p>Also try re-writing the line to be </p>

<pre><code>where sanitize_sql(["active = ? and expiration &gt; ?", true, Time.now]) 
</code></pre>

<p>Also try commenting out all the lines and gradually add them back to determine exactly where the error is occurring.</p>
