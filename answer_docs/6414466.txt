<p>In Firebug, you can open the "Console" panel. Every time an AJAX request is made, you'll see either GET or POST and the URL that the request was sent to logged. You can click on the triangle beside it to expand, and then click through the various tabs to see the data sent, the response back, and other assorted information.</p>

<p>EDIT: The XHR tab in the "Net" panel will show you the same information as well.</p>
