<p>You could use the LAST_INSERT_ID MySQL function in your second SQL statement to get the last insert ID from the first.  </p>

<pre><code>mysql_query("
    INSERT INTO `member_orders` (
        `order_id`, 
        `member_id`, 
        `date`, 
        `item`, 
        `size`, 
        `quantity`, 
        `price`, 
        `tracking_id`, 
        `status`, 
        `item_sent`, 
        `notes`
    ) VALUES (
        NULL, 
        LAST_INSERT_ID(), 
        '', 
        '', 
        '', 
        '', 
        '', 
        '', 
        '', 
        '', 
        ''
    )
");
</code></pre>

<p>I would recommend that if you use this approach then you execute the queries within a transaction.   That way there's no way that another insert can occur between your first insert and your second, thus throwing off the result of LAST_INSERT_ID. </p>
