<p>In an introduction to OpenCL (I do not remember which :-() it was mentioned not to plan to use the whole memory. Some additional data might be placed into the memory which are out of control of the programmer. The compiler might use the local memory for optimizations and other kernels might allocate memory, too. It was generally suggested not to use more than the half of the memory. Maybe this is something which happens here.</p>
