<p>I've ended up switching to Deepak's answer, but I also thought I would provide this in case it helps someone (or if people want to provide feedback).</p>

<p>In my <code>showAction</code> method defined above, I refactored it to this:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)someAction {
    AViewController *av = [[AViewController alloc]
        initWithNibName:nil bundle:nil];
    [av setToolbarItems:[[self.navigationController toolbar] items]];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:av animated:YES];
}
</code></pre>
