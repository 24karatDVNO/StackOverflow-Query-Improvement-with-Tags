<p>Hardwire/hack:</p>

<p>in the show_bug.cgi bugzilla code, modify it, with the equivalent of the following pseudocode:</p>

<p>if bugzilla title starts with [JIRAnnnnn] then
use the disable attribute in html forms, e.g. as described in:
  <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3789844/how-to-make-a-greyed-out-html-form">How to make a greyed-out HTML form?</a></p>

<p>end if</p>

<p>but i also need an automation to write the [JIRAnnnnn] prefix into the title of the bugzilla record, once the JIRA entry has been created</p>

<p>Also add a html wallpaper background to indicate migrated</p>
