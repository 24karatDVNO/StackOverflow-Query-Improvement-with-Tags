<p>No, you do not need to do this.  All property values are automatically set to their default value when a class constructor is called.  See <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/xwth0h0d%28v=vs.80%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">this page</a> for info on default values in C#.</p>

<p>You might want to consider it if you would rather have a string be empty rather than null, or whether or if you want a collection (a List for example) to be initialized automatically, though.  What you've done certainly isn't bad practice at all, just unnecessary.</p>
