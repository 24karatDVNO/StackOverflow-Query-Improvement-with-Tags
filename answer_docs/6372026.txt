<p>post your adapter code. </p>

<p>if you are changing the cursor on the adapter as you probably are. be sure to get the cursor from the adapter by calling </p>

<pre><code>    Cursor c = adapter.getCursor()
c.moveToPosition(position);
String description = c.getString(c.getColumnIndex("DESCRIPTION"));
</code></pre>

<p>the key thing is to move the cursor to the desired position in the list. also be sure you are using the attached cursor to the listView not a previously saved instance or from your first query when you were assigning it to the adapter.</p>
