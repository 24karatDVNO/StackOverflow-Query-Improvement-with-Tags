<p>I have a few suggestions:</p>

<p>One, more directly answering your question: have you looked into CSS frameworks? Things like the Grid960 System can go a long way to providing structure to your site quickly. You'd be surprised how quickly you can get something reasonable going using a pre-built layout file. You don't even have to use someone else's; you could make your own once and re-use and adapt as necessary.</p>

<p>Second, is why don't you try starting out with the CSS from the design in your head? It'll feel a lot less redundant when you go straight to the styling. This becomes even easier if you incorporate suggestion one. Not that you can't use Photoshop at the same time...but if you let the site grow out of CSS, it'll feel a lot more natural to use it.</p>

<p>And third, there are certain tools (that seem rather dubious to me) like <a href="http://www.psd2html.com" rel="nofollow" title="PSD2HTML">PSD2HTML</a> that purport to do that work for you.</p>
