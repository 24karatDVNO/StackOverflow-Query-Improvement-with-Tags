<p>The security aspects of this seem daunting.  You are basically trying to create a development environment within a browser?  I have always used ant/msbuild/makefiles to do my building and utilize the IDE just for a sanity check.  Seems like alot of work for something your could provide by letting users SSH into a development machine and open their IDE from there.  Us developers can get a little protective of their toolsets.  You could provide the same thing by enabling XDMCP and allowing remote logins.  However, if this is a project to see if you can do it, then there are alot of interesting problems hidden to solve.</p>
