<p>Mirror how stackoverflow does it. How many times have you been locked out of Stack Overflow? And they have processes for handing multiple open ids. </p>

<p>When you log into Facebook, they request the email permission with their API key and get your email address so they have a way to tie that to an existing email address. Same with when you auth with google, they request your email address from google/you. </p>
