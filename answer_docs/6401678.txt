<p>Maybe someone else could have an explanation for this answer, but the problem was:</p>

<p>I had a <strong>base href TAG</strong> (<code>&lt;base href="http://domain.com/" /&gt;</code>)</p>

<p>There are some references for problems with using jquery + base href out there.
I have no idea why, <strong>but removing this line fixed everything</strong>. thanks for all your help, I learned some web debugging\ajax tips in the process.</p>
