<p>Amazon offers a 1 week training in Seattle where they go through most of their APIs and give you code examples and use cases. All (or mosts) examples are in Java and includes real-case application code.</p>

<p>I have been to one of these and the trainer had EXTREMELY extensive knowledge of all the APIs and how to use them. It is really a fast track to understanding what are the numerous services of amazon and how they integrate.</p>

<p>Otherwise, there are a bunch of whitepapers: <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/" rel="nofollow">http://aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/</a></p>
