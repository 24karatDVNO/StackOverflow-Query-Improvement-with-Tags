<p>I like Alfred's pubsub idea.  I would think about the database as a subscriber to the insert events, not as the canonical version.  Maybe this isn't possible with your existing codebase. You might also be able to monitor the binary logs on the database server to watch changes come in and push this information to the subscribers. </p>
