<p>Your question is unclear, but in general the only reliable way to see if any resource is available is to try to use it. You have to cope with the exceptions that arise anyway, and using some other test prior to the real attempt isn't guaranteed to exercise the same paths and introduces a timing-window problem. So don't do it. Just write the code and catch the exceptions.</p>
