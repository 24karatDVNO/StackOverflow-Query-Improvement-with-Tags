<p>There is a "standard" to format international ( and national ) phone numbers. They look like this: +31 42 123 4567 (+country prefix number callthrough). Example taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.123" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>. Though you shouldn't expect anyone to enter it that way. In my experience users most likely will stick to the format they're used to.</p>

<p>I do not know of any library that will convert between all ( mostly local ) representations to that mentioned by me or any other format.</p>
