<p>You cannot use exactly same code for different requirements - you have to deal with it. Although, it is a best practice to use different adapted classes for your UI layer (viewmodels). And you don't need BLL layer at all (well, you need, but only for cross-cutting concerns) - take a look at <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0321125215" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Domain Driven Design</a>. And then in case of requirements changing you would need to change only domain object and its mapping to view model  (which could be easily done using tools like <a href="http://automapper.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Automapper</a>)</p>
