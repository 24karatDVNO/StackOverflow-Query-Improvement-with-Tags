<p>it seems that <code>$_POST['ime'];</code> is undefined and that means that you are not posting it i guess. </p>

<p>Are you sure that <code>yname.tekst2.value</code> is the correct way to access the value of the field?</p>

<p>If you have firebug you can check in the "console" tab what parametrs have been posted.</p>
