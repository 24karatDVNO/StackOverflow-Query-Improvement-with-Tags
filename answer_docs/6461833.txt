<p>I'm not sure the purpose of your DataSet here. This is the sort of syntax I've used in the past. (I think the Syntax is correct - I don't have my code here)</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlDataReader sdr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
{
  while (sdr.Read())
  {
    res.Add(sdr.GetString(sdr.GetOrdinal("Track_name")));
    trackIds.Add(sdr.GetInt32(sdr.GetOrdinal("Track_ID")).ToString())
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: and as stated in the comments, put a using around the SqlConnection to save you Closing / Disposing it yourself.</p>
