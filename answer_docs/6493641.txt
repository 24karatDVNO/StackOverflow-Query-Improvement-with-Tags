<p>You can always create a separate view with UIPickerView, that always easy to deal with and declare view,picker as iVars.Whenever you want to show the picker view, just add the view as <code>subView</code> and when you dont want to show it, remove the view by calling <code>removeFromSuperview</code>.</p>

<p>hope this helps!!</p>
