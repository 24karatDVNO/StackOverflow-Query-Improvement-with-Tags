<p>I use python-mode 5.2.0.</p>

<p>I went into python-mode.el and changed the switch-to-buffer-other-window to switch-to-buffer.
I evaluated it and now the interpreter opens up in the same window (regardless of the number of other windows I have).</p>

<p>Did you evaluate the function when you changed the above line?</p>

<p>Btw, opening the interpreter in another window is a feature, not a bug, IMHO. We want to be able to see the interpreter when we evaluate a region of code using C-c | or the buffer using C-c C-c.</p>
