<p>The </p>

<pre><code>while (pid!=wait(&amp;ReturnCode));
</code></pre>

<p>loop is comparing the process id (pid) returned by wait() to the pid received earlier from a <em>fork</em> or any other <em>process</em> starter. If it finds out that the <em>process</em> that has ended IS NOT the same as the one this <em>parent process</em> has been waiting for, it keeps on wait()ing.</p>
