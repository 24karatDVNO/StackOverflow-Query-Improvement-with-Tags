<p>This should give you the results:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT MIN(`id`) `id_from`, MAX(`id`) as `id_to`, COUNT(1) `count_id`
FROM `session`
GROUP BY (FLOOR(IF(id&gt;0, id-1, id) / 10));
</code></pre>

<p>Please feel free to change the table and column names as per your schema.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
