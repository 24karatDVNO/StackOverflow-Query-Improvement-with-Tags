<p>this.Page will give you a reference to the page object.</p>

<p>If you implement the DisplayMessage in a base page and then inherit from that.</p>

<p>you could cast this.Page as BasePage and then call the method that way :)</p>

<pre><code>if(this.Page is BasePage)
{
   BasePage bs = this.Page as BasePage

   bs.DisplayMessage(....)   
}
</code></pre>
