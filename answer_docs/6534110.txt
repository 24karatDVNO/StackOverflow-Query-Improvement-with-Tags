<p>Divs are not valid inside tables except inside cells (td and th).  If you need to split a table up into subsections, you can use thead, tfoot and tbody instead.  The thead and tfoot elements define the header and footer of your table respectively, and tbody defines a content block.  You can have 1 thead, 1 tfoot and any number of tbody elements you want in a table. </p>

<p>I'm not sure if you can have a scrolling tbody, though. At least not one that works in all browsers</p>
