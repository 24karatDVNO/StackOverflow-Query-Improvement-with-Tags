<p>Have you checked the basics?</p>

<p>Run 'grails' war', see if your class compiled and is inside the war?</p>

<p>Does it work from grails run-app, but not the tomcat?</p>

<p>What environment are you working in?  SpringSource ToolSuite (STS) now provides a Grails "run on server" option for servers managed by Eclipse (i.e. Tomcat), and can help you get the environment up and running quickly.</p>

<p>Note that Grails 1.3.x ships with Tomcat 6.0.x, the latest 1.4M1 milestone release supports Tomcat7, so you may want to try that.</p>
