<p>I would suggest you to read the section <strong>2. Dealing with Model Objects</strong> of <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html" rel="nofollow">the form helpers guide</a> or at least the <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html" rel="nofollow">ruby on rails starting guide</a> to figure out how to build a simple model and write controller and view (include new/edit views which contains form) for it.</p>
