<p>I was having an issue running Visual Studio 2010 via RDP where the IDE contents except the Solution Explorer wouldn't render. I went to Options->Environment->General->Visual experience and turned off the the "rich client visual experience" options. I suspect turning off "Use hardware graphics acceleration if available" did the trick.</p>
