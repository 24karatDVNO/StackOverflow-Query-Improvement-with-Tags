<p>I eventually fixed my problem by installing the drivers for Office 2007 on the server (the Office 2007 drivers don't involve the same problems as the Office 2007 applications in terms of licenses).</p>

<p>Here is the link : <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/confirmation.aspx?id=23734" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/confirmation.aspx?id=23734</a></p>

<p>Then I modified my connectionstring to </p>

<pre><code>@"Provider = Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0;Data Source = {0};Extended Properties =""Excel 12.0 Xml;HDR=YES;IMEX=1"";"
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this will help someone facing the same questions. :-)</p>
