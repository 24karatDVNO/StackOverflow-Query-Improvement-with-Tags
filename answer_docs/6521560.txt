<p>The simplest answer I can think of is that the icons are installed under another profile instead of for all users.  Can you search under the "Documents and Settings" folder for your icons?  That would tell you if they were installed under someone else (maybe the account you use to install the package.</p>

<p>Another thing to check is to be sure your computer didn't have icons before you installed it.  If you have been using your PC to test the installation, maybe a previous one left the icons there and it is masking the fact that you aren't really installing the icons anywhere.</p>

<p>Finally, check your permissions for the computer in Brazil.  Maybe you don't have administrative rights to write to the "All Users" locations.  It could be you have permissions to install your application (especially if you aren't installing it in "Program Files" but it is possible even if you have those rights) but you don't have rights to those folders.</p>
