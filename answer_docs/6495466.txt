<p>Check the file WebForm2.aspx.cs</p>

<p>If it's missing, recreate it.
If it's misnamed, fix the name to match the one here in bold
&lt;%@ Page Language="C#" AutoEventWireup="true" <strong>CodeBehind="WebForm2.aspx.cs"</strong> Inherits="StorageByMail.Web.WebForm2" %> </p>

<p>If the class or namespace does not match, fix that.</p>

<p>If is something else, and you can't figure it out, ask for more help here.</p>

<p>Ben is correct, check for Build errors, (Actually look at the errors tab)</p>
