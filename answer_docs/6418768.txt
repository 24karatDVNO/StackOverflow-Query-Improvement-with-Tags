<p>You have to understand that SQL works with the cartesian products of tables.</p>

<p>In your query, you'll have</p>

<pre><code>book1   book1cat1
book1   book1cat2
</code></pre>

<p>You are asking that, for each record, book1cat1 is both 3 AND 4. It is impossible as it can only be one of them.</p>
