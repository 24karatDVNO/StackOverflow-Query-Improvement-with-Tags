<p>you could try using (or creating your own) Pixel Bender shader.  <a href="http://www.dasprinzip.com/pExamples/p83.html" rel="nofollow">this</a> is just a quick example i found by googling "<em>pixel bender warp</em>".  it's not at all what you are looking for, but i wanted to show you what's possible - assuming you didn't already know. pixel bender shaders are just filters and do no require animation.</p>
