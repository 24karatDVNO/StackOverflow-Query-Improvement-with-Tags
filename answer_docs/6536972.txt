<p>While there are many ways to do this, you could keep it in a format that is human readable. An example for your case would be (Assuming mapping of distributor to factories is many to many)</p>

<pre><code>[distributor-id]-[factory-id]-[order-id]-[auto-increment-number]
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure if order-id is auto-increment-number itself for you, just customize it for your needs.</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
