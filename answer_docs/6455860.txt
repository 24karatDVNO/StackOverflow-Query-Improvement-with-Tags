<p>This is a config that works for us</p>

<pre><code>RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule .* index.php
</code></pre>

<p>If it does not work for you, there could be hundred of reasons, starting form insufficient permissions and ending with custom IIS configuration, etc.</p>

<p>Try to follow Troubleshooting section of documentation, try to start from enable logging and test some basic rewrites.</p>
