<p>Quicktabs will work fine, just override the look of the tabs with css and or <code>tpl.php</code> theme override files.</p>

<p>Or set up lots of different quicktabs and give them each a different display style, there are quite a few built in, and you can specify your own.</p>

<p>Or you could look at jQuery UI Tabs and use built in theme settings...</p>
