<p>If you're just wanting to to "basic" image manipulation functions, like color adjustments or things like that then you should probably just brush up on basic math and bit manipulation, you'd be surprised what you can accomplish with a few simple tricks (like in this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5055625/image-warping-bulge-effect-algorithm">post</a> and this <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/GDI-plus/csharpgraphicfilters11.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">article</a>).</p>

<p>However, if you're serious about image processing I would recommend <a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470643854.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Algorithms for Image Processing and Computer Vision</a>, the source is in C, but that doesn't change the underlying concepts.</p>
