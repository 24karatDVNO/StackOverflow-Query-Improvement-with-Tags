<p>This question of 2010 looks similar:
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4018615/jquery-ui-autocomplete-multiple-sources">Jquery ui autocomplete - multiple sources</a>
I would suggest combining the first answer with the second answer. As far as I remember when I was working with the JQuery autocomplete I found it required JavaScript Object Notation in order to function, not XML. </p>

<p>Hope this helps :)</p>
