<p>This solution finds both bulleted and numbered items at the beginning of the line of text, then removes them.</p>

<pre><code>var x="  1.     15-20 years  ";
x.replace(/^\s*(?:[••••]|\d+)\.\t/, '');
alert(x); // i want out put as 15-20 years
</code></pre>

<p>I think you are trying to replace a substring, instead of replacing with a regular expression.</p>
