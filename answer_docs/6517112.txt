<p>Just one approach. This restructures the array to associate users by company, then just iterates through them.</p>

<pre><code>$companies = array();
foreach($array as $user)
{
    $companies[$user['company_name']][] = $user['user_name'];
}

foreach($companies as $name =&gt; $userlist)
{
    echo $name . '&lt;br /&gt;';

    foreach($userlist as $user)
    {
        echo ' - ' . $user . '&lt;br /&gt;';
    }
}
</code></pre>
