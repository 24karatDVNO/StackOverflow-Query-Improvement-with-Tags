<p>Ye olde <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ZSI/2.0-rc3" rel="nofollow">ZSI</a> library can generate Python code from a WSDL definition but, compared to suds, it's quite painful to use and requires another really old module called PyXML. I'd stick to suds, auto-completion isn't worth all that.</p>
