<p>Maybe you can use a fast compression library like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/snappy/" rel="nofollow">Snappy</a>.  However, it can only compress a single file, and you surely don't want to transfer each file separately.  I'd create an uncompressed <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/" rel="nofollow">TAR</a> archive for that.</p>
