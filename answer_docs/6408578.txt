<p>I have been building a Symfony 2 application that is going into production next week!  I started developing on PR11 and have been updating the codebase as each beta has been released.</p>

<p>This has been relatively pain free, just update the vendors folder then making any necessary changes to your code as some things change  (usually just quicker and easier ways of doing the same thing, or some method renaming).</p>

<p>Bugs get found quickly by the community so as long as you keep updating your vendor directory I believe it's stable enough to start building with.  Stable release is due July:</p>
