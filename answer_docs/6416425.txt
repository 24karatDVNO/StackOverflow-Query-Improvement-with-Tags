<p>The click function is being applied to the rows with that class at the page load.</p>

<p>You have to use the live() method to get that working:</p>

<p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/live/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/live/</a></p>

<p>With live you can make that all the elements that match a given pattern during the entire life of the page have the same behavior.</p>

<pre><code>$('.row_delete').live('click',function(){...})
</code></pre>

<p>That should do it.</p>
