<p>The company Wingspan (http://wingspan) has an integration server for Documentum that supports 5.3 (and everything else going all the way back to 4.2.x).  It's called the DocWay Server and it has a Web Service API and separate Content Transfer facility.  It's similar in some ways to DFS, but predates it by many years and has been shipping since 2002.</p>

<p>I work there, and I'm sure pitching products is frowned upon on stack overflow, so I'll just leave it there.  PM me or contact Wingspan directly if you want more information.</p>

<p>Absent that, I would do just what you suggested and "[write a] custom web service in java using DFC and then integrate .NET application with this web service"</p>

<p>If you need to expose a lot of the DFC though, that's a tough hill to climb.  Do you have access to 5.3 SP6 of Content Server?  I believe that includes DFS which is more accessible from .NET.</p>
