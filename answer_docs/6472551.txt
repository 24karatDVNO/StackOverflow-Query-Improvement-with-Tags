<p>.NET properties are purely a syntax sugar, nothing else. CLR creates the same set/get methods with baking field under the hoods anyway. This is slightly more OOP to have a public property and not to expose public fields, and it brings you the ability to control the validation of the entry, for instance, on setter.</p>
