<p>I have a generic function for you to calculate the nth day of a month. Hope this could help you to resolve your issue.</p>

<pre><code>function get_Nth_dow($dow, $occurence, $m, $y)
{
    $numdays = date('t', mktime(0, 0, 0, $m, 1, $y));
    $add = 7 * ($occurence - 1);
    $firstdow = date('w', mktime(0, 0, 0, $m, 1, $y));
    $diff = $firstdow - $dow;

    $day_of_month = 1;
    if ($diff &gt; 0)
    {
        $day_of_month += ($add - $diff);
    }
    elseif ($diff &lt; $numdays)
    {
        $day_of_month -= ($diff - $add);
    }

    return $day_of_month;
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>$DOW</code> = day of the week (0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday).</p>

<p><code>$X</code> = occurence (1 = first, 2 = third, etc..). If the given month does </p>

<p>not have the occurrence, then it will return the last. For example, if </p>

<p>you ask for the 7th occurrence of Friday, it will return the last </p>

<p>Friday of the month.
<code>$M</code> = month
<code>$Y</code> = year</p>

<p>Example, <code>get_Nth_DOW(2,3,7,2009)</code> will return the third Tuesday of  7th 2009.</p>
