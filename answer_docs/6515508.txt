<p>example using itertools.groupby. <strong>This only works if the rows are already grouped by id</strong></p>

<pre><code>from csv import DictReader
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

filename = 'test.csv'

# the context manager ensures that infile is closed when it goes out of scope
with open(filename) as infile:

    # group by id - this requires that the rows are already grouped by id
    groups = groupby(DictReader(infile), key=itemgetter('id'))

    # loop through the groups printing a list for each one
    for i,j in groups:
        print [i, map(itemgetter(' serial_no'), list(j))]
</code></pre>

<p>note the space in front of <code>' serial_no'</code>. This is because of the space after the comma in the input file</p>
