<p>Ok, thanks Peter, at least I know not to look any further. I decided to take a different approach:</p>

<p>Use a script file to generate the database instead of generating it from code. This will make it more easy to have "versioning" on the database.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I am taking a look at sqlalchemy <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sqlalchemy.org/</a> which pretty much does what I want but is currently a step to far as it requires a drastic restructure of the application I am rebuilding</p>
