<p>I have an Informix-SQL 2.10 (year 1986) application running with no problems on DOS 6.22, in Microsoft Virtual PC 2007, on Windows XP, Vista and 7. If you cannot find 3.3, the next easiest solution would be to convert your database.dbd data to ISQL's database.dbs and do some minimal re-write of your perform and ace reports. </p>
