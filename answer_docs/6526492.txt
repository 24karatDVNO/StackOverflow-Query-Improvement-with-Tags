<p>You need to actually save the data in the Bundle. And then actually reload the data from the Bundle. You were very close.</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public void onSaveInstanceState(Bundle outState){
    super.onSaveInstanceState(outState);
    outState.putString("text1", text1.getText().toString());
}
public void reloadState(){
    text1.setText(outState.getString("text1"));
}
</code></pre>
