<p>Have you tried opening up the Project file. For example, my project file is named <code>menu.pro</code> and it contains the following:</p>

<pre><code>TEMPLATE = app
QT = gui core
CONFIG += qt debug warn_on console
DESTDIR = bin
OBJECTS_DIR = build
MOC_DIR = build
UI_DIR = build
FORMS = ui/mainwindow.ui
HEADERS = src/mainwindowimpl.h
SOURCES = src/mainwindowimpl.cpp src/main.cpp
RESOURCES = Images.qrc
</code></pre>

<p>The last line (<code>RESOURCES = Images.qrc</code>) is what you need to put in your project file: of course, use the name that you used for your resources file, in my case, it is <code>Images.qrc</code>.</p>
