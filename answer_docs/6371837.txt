<p>Try this</p>

<pre><code>      SELECT COUNT(a.user_id) 
      FROM announce_arrival AS a       
      INNER JOIN members as m1 ON (a.user_id = m1.mem_id)
      INNER JOIN members as m2 ON (a.venue_id= m2.mem_id)
      GROUP BY  a.user_id LIMIT 0,10;
</code></pre>

<p>If you are using count no need to give order by</p>
