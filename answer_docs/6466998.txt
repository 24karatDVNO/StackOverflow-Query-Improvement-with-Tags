<p>One way is to use the RadWindow like a modal and pop it up to the user via client-side JavaScript.  We use RadWindows in our applications and it works.  Or, the RadWindow supports a Nested Grid or View that you can have as a record's child; so you can have the master record, click on the arrow on the left and expand the record to view a nested grid of data, or a custom view (via the NestedViewTemplate property).  You can also have the form in a DIV, hide it, then show it via JavaScript too.</p>

<p>Those are two ways.</p>

<p>HTH.</p>
