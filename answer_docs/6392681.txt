<p>I am glad that nobody wasted their time trying to work their way through my code.</p>

<p>Turns out that it was requiresUniqueEmail="false" that needed to be present in my AspNetSqlMembershipProvider. It was set to "true" and the code never got past it.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting and cheers for your intentions.</p>
