<p>If you want to see a code for handwritten parsers then I suggest looking for gcc and various xml parsers. You can start reading from <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GNU_C_Compiler_Internals/GNU_C_Compiler_Architecture_3_4" rel="nofollow">here</a> about gcc architecture. Type <em>"xml parser source code"</em> in your favorite search engine and you will have plenty of examples of xml parsers. If you are more interested in learning how to write <em>native</em> parser libraries, which don't require extra step of code generation, you can look at boost::Spirit (C++) or AXE (C++0x). Also check <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators" rel="nofollow">this table</a> for various projects, some of them offer source code, but you will need to do mining yourself.</p>
