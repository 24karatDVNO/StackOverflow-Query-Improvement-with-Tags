<p>You're right on thinking that your timing is wrong :)</p>

<pre><code>// js
$("someElement").load("file.php", function(){
    var num = $("div#max_page").attr("title");
    // here you can do with num whatever you need
});
</code></pre>

<p>The function passed as a second argument will be executed immediately after <code>file.php</code> is loaded into <code>someElement</code>, thus guaranteed that the title attribute will exist at this point.</p>
