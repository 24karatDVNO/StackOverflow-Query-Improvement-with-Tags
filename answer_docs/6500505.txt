<p>You have two options:</p>

<ol>
<li>To make a virtual view. In this case you
will load only visible elements and
do scrolling/panning manually
(similar to maps)</li>
<li>To output/populate just text
"xxxxx...." and handle clicks by
coordinates and synthesizing
hyperlink clicks by code. In this
case you will have only one DOM
element - container of x'es</li>
</ol>
