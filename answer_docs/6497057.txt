<p>In PHP, headers need to be sent before any HTML is displayed. Probably the easiest way to do that is to submit a form:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
// Since this is before the DOCTYPE, you can still send headers.
if (isset($_POST['foo'])) {
    header('location: new-url.html');
}
?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;!-- rest of the page goes here --&gt;
</code></pre>
