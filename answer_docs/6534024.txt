<p>You can use transform &amp; animation:</p>

<pre><code>[UIView animateWithDuration:0.5
                 animations:^{
                     self.transform = CGAffineTransformRotate(self.transform, 30);
                 } 
                 completion:^(BOOL completed){
                     NSLog(@"Completed");
                 }];
</code></pre>

<p>Just remember frame is invalid after transform. I think u can set some conditions to change the duration accordingly as yr requirements. Any further question just post it here.</p>
