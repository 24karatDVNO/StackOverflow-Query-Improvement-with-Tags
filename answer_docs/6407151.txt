<p>I have figured out the problem. Try this url <a href="http://tuckey.org/res/dtds/urlrewrite3.1.dtd" rel="nofollow">http://tuckey.org/res/dtds/urlrewrite3.1.dtd</a> with your browse and you will see it's redirecting you to completely different html page instead of dtd file. So here is what I did. I found dtd file from tuckey jar and copied the content to {workspace}/.metadata/.plugins/org.eclipse.wst.internet.cache/279269156.cache and deleted the warnings from markers view and revalidated. Rememer 279269156.cache cache file's name will vary. So you have to find which is the bad file by opening the cache file with some editor</p>
