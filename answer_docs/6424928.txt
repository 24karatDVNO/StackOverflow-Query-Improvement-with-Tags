<p>you have posted this question in sql server, I have a answer in oracle database system (don't know whether it will run in sql server as well or not)</p>

<p>this is as follow-</p>

<pre><code>select [desired column list] from 
    (select b.*, count(*) over (partition by b.foreignkey) c_1
      from b
     where b.foreignkey in (select a.id from a) )

where c_1 &lt; 3 ;
</code></pre>

<p>i hope it should work on sql server as well...
if not please let me update ..</p>
