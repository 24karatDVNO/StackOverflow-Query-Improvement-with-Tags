<p>It looks like listxattr returns the size of the buffer it has filled, so you can use that to help you. Here's an idea:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i=0; i&lt;res-1; i++)
{
    if( buffer[i] == 0 )
        buffer[i] = ',';
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, instead of being separated by null characters, the attributes are separated by commas.</p>
