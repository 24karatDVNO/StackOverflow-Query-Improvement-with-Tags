<p>This isn't really a quick solution for you, but I highly recommend reading Ethan Marcotte's Responsive Web Design articles on <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/responsive-web-design/" rel="nofollow">alistapart.org</a>. He goes over the philosophy as well as the practical steps to make a site work well for different contexts - desktop browser to mobile device, etc. There are several articles on the site (just search for responsive web design you'll get several of his articles in your results.)</p>
