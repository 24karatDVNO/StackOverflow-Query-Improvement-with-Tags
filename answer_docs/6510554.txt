<p>Assuming you already have an opened session in a CurrentSession property/variable and that you could pass that working session to your repository, I would do the following:</p>

<pre><code>using(var trx = CurrentSession.BeginTransaction())
{
    try
    {
        int newId = this.Repository.Save(obj, CurrentSession);  
        webservice.Save(remoteObj, id);

        trx.Commit();
    }
    catch
    {
        trx.Rollback();
    }
}
</code></pre>
