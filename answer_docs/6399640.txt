<p>Since you have no jQuery or JS experience, I would suggest starting from Google (for example with <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=jquery%20menu%20bar" rel="nofollow">this query</a>). You will find lots of hits (try the first one) which present lots of dynamic menus and include both live demos and tutorials.</p>

<p>Select one that looks about right visually and feature-wise, then follow the corresponding tute. If you have problems, come back to SO with more specific questions.</p>
