<p>I'm guessing you are inquiring only about "designing" the output. If so, the question become more vague.</p>

<p>Designing depends on how you wish to show these data to your viewers. If you want a tabular structure, use <code>&lt;table&gt;</code>. Or if they are to be shown as a list, use <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and use CSS to style it. Adding style properties inline is a very bad approach. Avoid that.</p>

<p>Like Alex said, this question is very open ended and vague. Try refining your question a little more.</p>
