<p>As you noticed, Your project runs fine using <strong>Glassfish.</strong> The most logical idea behind your problem is that your Tomcat container does not have the required libraries.
Glassfish comes along shipped with all the necessary <strong>libraries</strong> for a JSF based web application or an EJB App (e.g : <strong>jsf-imp*<em>l, Mysql connector, *</em><code>jsf-api</code>,</strong> mojarra impl, the list is long).</p>

<p>You can try copying these libraries in the LIB folder of your tomcat and restart it.
