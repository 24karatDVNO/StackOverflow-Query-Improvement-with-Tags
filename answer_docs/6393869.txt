<p>Okay, let's think this out.  You want to go through the vector one by one and find the maximum vaue; you want to keep track of the value's index.  Here's some pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code> index = 0
 for each value in the array from 0 to end
    if this is the highest value you've seen so far
       save value
       save index of value

 print index
</code></pre>

<p>How can you do these in C++?</p>
