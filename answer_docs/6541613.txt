<p>You can look at <a href="https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2" rel="nofollow">python-oauth2</a>. <a href="https://github.com/simplegeo/python-oauth2/blob/master/oauth2/__init__.py" rel="nofollow">The main implementation code</a> is very readable. Since there are a lot of thorny issues here like precisely how you encode your forms it is tricky to get right. I would recommend just using the oauth2 library, that is what I've done to integrate with Twitter (httplib2 + oauth2 + Twitter's REST/streaming APIs).</p>
