<p>If you want to compare based on single column, then you can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ID FROM B LEFT JOIN A ON B.ID = A.ID WHERE A.ID IS NULL;
</code></pre>

<p>The above query will give you the list of records that are not present in A but in B.</p>

<p>Instead if you want to compare the entire row, you can use the following approach:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) FROM B;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM A;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT * FROM B UNION SELECT * FROM A
)
</code></pre>

<p>If all the queries returns the same count then you can assume that both the tables are exactly equal.</p>
