<p>I haven't actually done this before, but I have adapted some of my code (that makes a enemy ship face the player ship) to what you need.  Hopefully this is correct.</p>

<pre><code>//rotate to face the touch
CGPoint diff = ccpSub(sprite.position, touch.position);
float angleRadians = atanf((float)diff.y / (float)diff.x);

float angleOffset = CC_DEGREES_TO_RADIANS(90);

if(diff.x &lt; 0)
{
    angleRadians += angleOffset;
}
else
{
    angleRadians -= angleOffset;
}
</code></pre>

<p>PengOne's answer (cool name BTW) was great though and I am voting it up because you should make use of it.</p>
