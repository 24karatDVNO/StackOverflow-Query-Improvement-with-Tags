<p>Following would work if your <code>Value</code> column is sequential</p>

<pre><code>;WITH q (Value) AS (
    SELECT  1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT  q.Value + 1
    FROM    q
    WHERE   q.Value &lt; 38
)

SELECT  q.Value
        , CASE WHEN q.Value &gt;= 4 THEN q.Value * 4 - 6 ELSE NULL END
FROM    q       
</code></pre>

<p>otherwise you might use something like this</p>

<pre><code>;WITH q (Value) AS (
    SELECT  1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT  q.Value + 1
    FROM    q
    WHERE   q.Value &lt; 38
)
, Sequential (ID, Value) AS (
    SELECT  ID = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Value)
            , Value
    FROM    q
)
SELECT  s1.Value
        , [SUM] = s1.Value + s2.Value + s3.Value + s4.Value
FROM    Sequential s1
        LEFT OUTER JOIN Sequential s2 ON s2.ID = s1.ID - 1
        LEFT OUTER JOIN Sequential s3 ON s3.ID = s2.ID - 1
        LEFT OUTER JOIN Sequential s4 ON s4.ID = s3.ID - 1
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the table <code>q</code>in the examples is a stub for your actual table. The actual statement then becomes</p>

<pre><code>;WITH Sequential (ID, Value) AS (
    SELECT  ID = ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY Value)
            , Value
    FROM    YourTable
)
SELECT  s1.Value
        , [SUM] = s1.Value + s2.Value + s3.Value + s4.Value
FROM    Sequential s1
        LEFT OUTER JOIN Sequential s2 ON s2.ID = s1.ID - 1
        LEFT OUTER JOIN Sequential s3 ON s3.ID = s2.ID - 1
        LEFT OUTER JOIN Sequential s4 ON s4.ID = s3.ID - 1
</code></pre>
