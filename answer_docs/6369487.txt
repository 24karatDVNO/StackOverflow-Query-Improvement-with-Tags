<p>Assuming that you have already built the Formatter implementation, you'll need to bind this to a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/Handler.html" rel="nofollow">Handler instance</a>, so that the said handler will apply the formatter when logging the LogRecord objects (after all, that's how <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/util/logging/overview.html#1.1" rel="nofollow">the Logging API was designed</a>).</p>

<p>This is done by get a reference to the Handler instance of interest (you'll need to manage the creation of handlers in order to get a reference to them), and then invoking the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/logging/Handler.html#setFormatter%28java.util.logging.Formatter%29" rel="nofollow">setFormatter()</a> method on it.</p>
