<p>To achieve this you need to set the validate-variable within your model like this:</p>

<pre><code># /app/models/album.php (or whatever you called your model)

var $validate = array(
    'albumname' =&gt; array(
        'rule' =&gt; 'alphaNumeric',
        'required' =&gt; true
    )
);
</code></pre>

<p>This will make sure that your fields are getting validated by CakePHP and if the validation isn't passed you get redirected to the form without anything being saved.</p>
