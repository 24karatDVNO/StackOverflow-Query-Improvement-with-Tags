<p>jQuery doesn't have any unique URL parsing abilities aside from what JavaScript itself provides. You can get the URL path with:</p>

<pre><code>var path = location.pathname;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can get the parts of the path with:</p>

<pre><code>var parts = path.split('/');
</code></pre>

<p>Then, just loop through the parts and generate your breadcrumb HTML as you see fit.</p>
