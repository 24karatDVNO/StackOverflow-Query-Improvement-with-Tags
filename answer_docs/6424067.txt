<p><strong>UserMessageFormatAndSendService</strong> should implement your service interface
say, <strong>IUserMessageService</strong> - this way you could test it and/or replace functionality when needed</p>

<p>The class itself (UserMessageFormatAndSendService) is not "The Service", it is a proxy to the real service, so you could call it <strong>UserMessageServiceAgent</strong>.</p>
