<p>I would suggest looking into the <a href="https://github.com/apeiros/awesome_nested_set" rel="nofollow">awesome_nested_set</a> gem to see if you can represent your hierarchy that way. Basically you have to add 3 new columns to your existing model and you get all the standard tree support. Then you can add one or two simple routes to the related controller and you should be good to go.</p>
