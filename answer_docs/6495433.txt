<p>You need to check if your source files or assemblies contain this class <code>Foo.Web.WebForm2</code>.</p>

<p>It seems like a class belonging to .aspx page and hence my first step would be to look into ASPX files containing something like <code>WebForm2.aspx</code>.</p>

<p>If its there, you might want to double check its namespace and where it's being referenced.</p>
