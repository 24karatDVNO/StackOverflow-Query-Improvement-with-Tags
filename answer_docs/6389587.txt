<p>Actually, nothing is automatically saved in storage.  The information is buffered into the role on disk and then transferred (on demand or scheduled) to storage.  So, you can definitely do the same thing with EventLogs.  You just use them like normal, configure Diagnostics to monitor them and occasionally transfer to storage.  Use the Windows Azure MMC for a free tool to do this easily.</p>
