<p>The <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/typesValues.html#4.1" rel="nofollow">Java Language Spec</a> uses the terms "primitive" and "reference" to make that distinction for both variables and values. This might be confusing in the context of a different programming language where "reference" means something else. </p>

<p>However, I can't tell if that is exactly the distinction you're trying to make. If you want to lump strings and object wrappers like <code>Integer</code> in with the Java primitive types like <code>int</code> you might be distinguishing scaler from non-scaler. Not all non-scalers are collections, of course.</p>
