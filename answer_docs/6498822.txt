<p>Thanks to @igorw, the <a href="https://github.com/igrigorik/async-rails" rel="nofollow">async-rails</a> project is what I was imagining.</p>

<p>But as @Raynos and @apneadiving point out, there are potentially better solutions such as <a href="http://rubyeventmachine.com/" rel="nofollow">Ruby EventMachine</a> and <a href="https://github.com/guileen/stormjs" rel="nofollow">stormjs</a>.</p>
