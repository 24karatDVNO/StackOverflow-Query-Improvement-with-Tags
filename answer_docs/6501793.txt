<p>There is no way to prevent a determined user from accessing the content of your web page.  Tools like firebug, and a plethora of screen capture software easily circumvent any such attempts.  </p>

<p>To make it difficult for unsophisticated or lazy users, you could overlay a transparent 1x1 image over the top of the entire page, or content you are trying to protect.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src="transparent.png" style = "width:100%; height:100%;position:absolute;" /&gt;
</code></pre>
