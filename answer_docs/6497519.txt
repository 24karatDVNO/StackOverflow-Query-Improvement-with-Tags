<p>The problem was with the GridFieldManager in Blackberry OS 5.0.  I found a custom one <a href="http://www.assembla.com/code/psu-edu-sweng500/subversion/nodes/trunk/rimapp/src/com/thinkingblackberry/GridFieldManager.java" rel="nofollow">here</a>, subclassed directly from <code>net.rim.device.api.ui.Manager</code>, that fixed the issue.</p>
