<p>Since I cant comment yet, use onUnload().</p>

<p>It fires on full postbacks too. Ajax postbacks dont fire!</p>

<p>What you need to do, is guaranty inside the onUload function that you only clear the session when you want. Like setting a variable isPostBack to true before the postbacks so onUnload sees the variable and doenst send a request to clear the session.</p>
