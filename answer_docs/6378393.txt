<p>What you try here is a kind of creation of a new document, it will not work at least in IE this way.<br>
Put this line </p>

<pre><code>alert(parent.innerHTML)
</code></pre>

<p>right after:</p>

<pre><code>parent.innerHTML = html_text; 
</code></pre>

<p>...and you will see, that you only get the contents of the body, everything else has been omitted.</p>

<p>If the response is valid xml, <code>request.responseXML</code> should be available, you can inspect it directly(it's already a document).</p>
