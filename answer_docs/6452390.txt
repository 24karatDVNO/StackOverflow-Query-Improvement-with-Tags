<p>I had this problem and was very difficult to find answers in internet. But i had luck, and I found an answer that worked for me.</p>

<p>Please remove in your code <strike>android:layout_height="wrap_content"</strike> and add these two new lines into your <code>Listview</code></p>

<pre><code>android:layout_height="0dip"
android:layout_weight="1"
</code></pre>

<p>Your Listview code should look like this</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ListView 
        android:id="@+id/android:list" 
        android:layout_alignParentTop="true"
        android:layout_width="fill_parent" 

        android:layout_height="0dip"
        android:layout_weight="1"
/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that works for you.</p>
