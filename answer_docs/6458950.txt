<p>You could try something like this ... untested, but I've seen similar queries.<br>
Let me know if it works...</p>

<pre><code>SELECT "Fruits",
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.order_date 
        BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('DAY', LOCALTIMESTAMP) AND DATE_TRUNC('DAY', LOCALTIMESTAMP) + INTERVAL '1 DAY' 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS daily, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.order_date 
        BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', LOCALTIMESTAMP) AND DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', LOCALTIMESTAMP) + INTERVAL '1 MONTH' 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS monthly, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.order_date 
        BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('YEAR', LOCALTIMESTAMP) AND DATE_TRUNC('YEAR', LOCALTIMESTAMP) + INTERVAL '1 YEAR' 
        THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS yearly, 
    SUM(CASE WHEN r.order_date &gt;= '01-01-2011 00:00:00' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS lifetime 
FROM reports AS r
    ,(SELECT "ID",
             CASE

                ELSE 'Other'
             END AS "Fruits" FROM "TypeOfFruits" ) AS "tof"
