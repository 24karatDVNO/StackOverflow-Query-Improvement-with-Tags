<p>I think what you want is an "Execution Wrapper" or a platform specific "Launcher"... typically this component is used to detect your OS and architecture and dependencies and then makes adjustments before launching your application. It is an old school design pattern (talking 80's and earlier) but is still used a lot today. The idea is that you program can be system and environment agnostic and the launcher will make preparations and tell the software everything it needs to know. Many modern open source programs do this with Shell scripts and Batch Files, etc... Apache Tomcat for example. You could just as easily make the wrapper in java an have it launch the software with a command line exec (be sure to add " &amp;" to the end of you exec command in *NIX so your wrapper can exit leaving only your software running... also lets you close the shell window without killing the process) </p>
