<p>Fiddler is a great tool for sniffing HTTP requests. You can download it <a href="http://www.fiddler2.com/fiddler2/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>Also, Google Chrome's Developer section (shortcut : <code>ctrl + shift + j</code>) has a <code>Network</code> Tab, which gives you info about time and http request. It is not as detailed as fiddler though!</p>
