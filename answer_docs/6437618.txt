<p>No man, you are on the wrong way.Due to the limitations of iphoneSDK such thing is not possible.In local notification it will only show the two buttons in alert View. </p>

<pre><code>1)Cancel
2)View
</code></pre>

<p>Still you can rename the View button to you wish:</p>

<pre><code>localNotif.alertAction = @"Snooze";
</code></pre>

<p>rahter than renaming the Cancel button.</p>
