<p>Is data in the text file well formatted? </p>

<p>If the data is well formatted as several columns, you can import the text file into SQL Server and do SQL query in the generated database table.</p>

<p>If don't know how to do that in SQL Server please let me know, I will continue to show you how to do that.</p>

<p>If your data is not well formatted in the text file or not in several columns, please also let know, and show me what does the data look like. Then I am glad to discuss it with you.</p>
