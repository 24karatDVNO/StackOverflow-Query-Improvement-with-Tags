<p>What you're doing is calling the async implementation of Download File.</p>

<p>For simplicity you can use-</p>

<pre><code>webClient.DownloadFile(new Uri("http://download1us.softpedia.com/dl/f4932a906a7dd98c7ff002b07e9bd94b/4e065004/100079174/software/portable/security/ccsetup307.zip"), @"ccsetup307.zip");
</code></pre>

<p>Without the events registring.</p>
