<p>Long story short, the "loose" MSD objects had a GC roots path up to Portal objects, so I am tentatively assuming those are the Portal sessions; either that or they are in the process of being released as they are maybe de-referenced by the container and then set loose ... I didn't check all the path-to-GC-roots.</p>
