<p>Since it's a homework, I won't post a complete solution, just an idea. Take a look on <code>std::max_element</code>(for example, <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/algorithm/max_element/" rel="nofollow">here</a>) . It returns an iterator, and if it is not equal your <code>array.end()</code> you can get a distance between it and <code>array.begin()</code> which will be the index you are looking for.</p>
