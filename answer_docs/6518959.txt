<p>Tornado is a simple, fast python webserver and a micro web framework. Its provides the very basic framework to write a dynamic website. Its very easy to learn and extend to meet specific need of a demanding web application since it does not come in your way. The best part of using Tornado is it does not create thread per request so scales very nicely for large number of requests. I am using it for one of my project and loving it.</p>
