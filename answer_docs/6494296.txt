<p>As far as the slf4j documentation for android says it is just a fascade that uses the native android logger to see the log info in DDMS.</p>

<p>if you want to upload logs you need to save them to a file or something like that. and then upload. See the java File writer methods and search also for ways to upload files in java,</p>

<p>if you want logging support that will handle sending error reports to a server there is a really nice library for android called ACRA. its excelent. you can post to google forms or post to your own server among some other really neat features.</p>
