<p>jQuery <code>.data('foo','bar')</code> is [essentially] just an attribute <code>data-foo="bar"</code> applied to the element. So, as long as the element exists in the DOM, so does the data that's attached to it.</p>

<p>Not sure what you're trying to accomplish though, so can't be more specific. Maybe elaborate a bit on what you're trying to accomplish (work-flow, etc.)?</p>
