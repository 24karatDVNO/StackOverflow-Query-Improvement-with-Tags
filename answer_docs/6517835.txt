<p>I usually use <a href="http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/index.php" rel="nofollow">phpMyAdmin</a> if web access is required or I have LAMP stack setup, or otherwise I use <a href="http://wb.mysql.com/" rel="nofollow">MySQL Workbench</a>.</p>

<p>At work I also use <a href="http://www.sqldbx.com/personal_edition.htm" rel="nofollow">SqlDbx</a> which is pretty awesome and does what I need.</p>
