<p>Haven't used Jipsi myself, though I intend to try it out soon.
From what I understand, you can send printjobs to a networkprinter which is declared on a server. This could be an Active Directory (domain) server in a Microsoft setup, or a Cups server which is on Linux.</p>

<p>Let me know if this works for you.</p>
