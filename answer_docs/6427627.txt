<p>I'd rather not be the bearer of bad news, but it's not possible for a Safari extension to programmatically change its own (much less any other) info.plist file. At least, there is no documented API method for doing so.</p>

<p>If you want to store a setting, using the safari.extension.settings object (or .secureSettings object) is the conventional way to do itâ€”but that's probably not what you had in mind.</p>
