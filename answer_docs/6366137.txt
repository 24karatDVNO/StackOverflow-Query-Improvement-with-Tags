<p>I don't know of a built-in process for this, but adding it using a macro took only about a minute. I opened up a PHP file. Since every method in PHP has the word <code>function</code> in it, I began recording a macro, performed a find for <code>function</code>, stopped recording, saved the macro, assigned the key equivalent Cmd-Opt-F. Now wherever my cursor is in the file, I can press Cmd-Opt-F and it will take me to the next function. Using regular expressions in the search would allow you to further refine it so that you don't find the word <code>function</code> unless it's actually defining a method.</p>
