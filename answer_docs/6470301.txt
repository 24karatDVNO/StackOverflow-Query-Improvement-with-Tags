<p>I had the same issue while accessing a WCF service providing multiple endpoints through PHP. In my case, it turned out that the main WSDL imports sub-WSDLs for each endpoint, while the sub-WSDLs do include the main-WSDL in turn. This is apparently the reason why PHP reads the main-WSDL twice and comes up with the "already defined"-error. I could avoid this behavior by creating the client with the sub-WSDL URL of the desired endpoint instead of the main WSDL URL.</p>
