<p>on your desktop computer, go to <a href="https://build.phonegap.com/apps" rel="nofollow">https://build.phonegap.com/apps</a>, and click the name of your app (not the d/l links)</p>

<p>it will show a list of qr codes, one for each platform</p>

<p>on your blackberry, open App World, menu, scan a barcode, then scan the qr code and it will download it like a normal app</p>
