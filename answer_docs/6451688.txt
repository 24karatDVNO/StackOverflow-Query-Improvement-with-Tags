<p>After a wild search i finally found something that I could use. <a href="http://www.jfileupload.com/products/jfileupload/index.html" rel="nofollow">This java applet</a> lets me upload endless amounts of files, zips them down and i managed to pass a php variable into the applet so the zip file is stored with the users e-mail adress as the filename. Cost me $29 though, but well worth it since I now have full control of where the files go, and who uploadeded them.</p>
