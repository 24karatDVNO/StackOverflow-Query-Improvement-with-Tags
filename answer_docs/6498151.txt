<p>Better documentation is more important when you're the only one interacting with the methods. Standard method definition commenting gives you well documented methods that can easily be compiled into an API that is then used in many IDEs.</p>

<p>When you're exposing your libraries or your inputs to other people, though, it is nice to do type checking and throw errors if your code won't work with their input. Type checking on user input protects you from errors and hacking attempts, and as a library letting other developers know that the input they provided is not what you're expecting is sometimes nice.</p>
