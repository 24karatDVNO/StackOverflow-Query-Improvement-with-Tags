<p>You can't get background image. <a href="http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/7.0.0api/net/rim/blackberry/api/homescreen/HomeScreen.html" rel="nofollow">HomeScreen</a> class in the API lets you only to set the background image. To give you an idea, several applications that adds text to background was pushing users to select the background first. I recommend you to do so and after first run of your application, you can save the path.</p>
