<p>You may want to take a look at this project <a href="http://www.phonegap.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.phonegap.com/</a> as a possible longer term solution for the problem of accessing device files.  What this system does is provide you with a javascript API for some of the devices actual hardware features, possibly including the file IO you would need to manipulate large files.  Its been an open source project that has been around for quite some time, but has some tradeoffs, like you have to actually deploy a separate binary to each target OS. :-/</p>
