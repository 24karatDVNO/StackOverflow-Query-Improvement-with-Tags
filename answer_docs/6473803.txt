<p>If you are using IIS7 you can check what connection string is being used by clicking the connection strings icon. See if it still exists. If that's the case check your solutions properties to make sure that the build action is set to content, and the Copy to Output Directory is set at least to copy if newer. </p>

<p>My second guess would be to check if the folder containing your files allows access to the Network Service user, or IUSR depending on which IIS is using. </p>
