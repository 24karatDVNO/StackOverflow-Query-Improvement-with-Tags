<p>For me, in Eclipse 3.6,  this problem occurs when my main method is not public.  I caused the problem by having a main method like this:</p>

<pre><code>static void main(String[] args) 
</code></pre>

<p>The dubugger was unable to detect this by itself.  I am pretty suprised Eclipse overlooked this.</p>
