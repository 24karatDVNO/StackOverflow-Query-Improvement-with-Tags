<p>You can't hide the titlebar, but with Javascript events, you can make it close when it loses focus.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
window.onblur=function() {
  window.close();
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Note: Some browsers disable the JavaScript close function. However, if it was your JavaScript code that opened the window, it should work.</p>
