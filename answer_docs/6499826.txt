<p>As you mentioned in your question, support for SVG was compiled into the Webkit browser for Android 3.0. I just tried the Android 3.1 emulator, and it is working there as well:</p>

<p>So it appears as though, for future releases, we can probably count on SVG support being included in the Webkit browser.</p>

<p>I am not aware of any work being done to bring SVG to the webkit browser on earlier versions of Android.</p>
