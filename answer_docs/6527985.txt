<p>I gave Mark a +1 but I'll offer an alternative as well, could you work around the issue by serving the content through mirroring on a CDN (such as Akamai) or host it entirely on a video CDN (such as Bits on the Run (http://www.longtailvideo.com/bits-on-the-run/)?</p>

<p>This would likely result in lower bandwidth cost and better performance as well, rather than constantly serving video from Sitecore.</p>
