<p>You could use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9eee01cx%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">CustomValidator</a> but i would prefer using three distinct validators, one for every TextBox.</p>

<p>It's possible to leave the ControlToValidate-property of the CustomValidator empty. On this way you can validate multiple controls at the same time.</p>
