<p>I cannot provide you with a good reason, but the type of the expression is given by the Java Language Specification: <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/expressions.html#15.25" rel="nofollow">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html/expressions.html#15.25</a></p>

<p>In the JLS all the numeric types are treated as special cases.</p>
