<p>UPDATE:</p>

<p>I decided, appropriately enough, to take a hybrid approach. I'm using inno to build the setup.exe, but inside of that setup I'm packaging the setup file that's generated by P&amp;DW. The P&amp;DW takes care of all the dll crap for me, we already know it works so I don't have to worry about screwing it up, and I can just focus on making all the .NET portions install properly. It is a little bit goofy having an installer run during another installer, but it's actually a pretty small compromise, considering.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the tips, everybody!</p>
