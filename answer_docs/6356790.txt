<p>I've had a similar problem when referencing a type in my configuration file. As Conrad Frix suggested, you need a reference to the assembly name after the namespace type reference. I have made the mistake of putting down what I think the assembly name is rather than checking it may have a different name to the name of the project. You can make sure by right clicking on the project in Visual Studio and going to properties. Double check to make sure that the project is outputting an assembly with the same name as you are specifying in your web.config.</p>
