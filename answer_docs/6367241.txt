<p>You need to make a loop that will test if the location is within x miles of the user. here is an example of what i mean that i used in my own code </p>

<pre><code>for (CLLocation *prox in locations) {
    NSLog(@"prox %@", prox);
    float distanceFromLocation = [mapView.userLocation.location distanceFromLocation:prox]/1609.344;
    NSLog(@"distance %f", distanceFromLocation);
    if (distanceFromLocation &lt;= 10) {
        NearbyLocation *nearbyLocation = [[NearbyLocation alloc]init];
        NSString *key = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", index];
        nearbyLocation.title = [storedTitles objectForKey:key];
        nearbyLocation.loction = prox;
        nearbyLocation.subtitle = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%.1f miles away", distanceFromLocation];
        nearbyLocation.lat = prox.coordinate.latitude;
        nearbyLocation.lon = prox.coordinate.longitude;
        [newArray addObject:nearbyLocation];
        [nearbyLocation release];
    }
    index++;
}
NSLog(@"new array %d prox %d", [newArray count], [proximityOutlet.nearbyLocations count]);
if ([newArray count] &gt; [proximityOutlet.nearbyLocations count]) {
    NSLog(@"set array");
    // if the new array has actually added any objects, set the array and switch views;
    proximityOutlet.nearbyLocations = newArray;
    //[self.navigationController pushViewController:proximityOutlet animated:YES];
    proximityOutlet.modalPresentationStyle = UIModalPresentationPageSheet;
    proximityOutlet.modalTransitionStyle = UIModalTransitionStyleCrossDissolve;
    [self presentModalViewController:proximityOutlet animated:YES];
}
[newArray release];

}
</code></pre>

<p>basically, create a loop that will search through an array of locations. have it 
    [mapView.userLocation.location distanceFrom:prox]/1609.334   //prox representing an instance of a location that is tested to see if the within x miles of the user.</p>

<p>then say </p>

<pre><code>if ([mapview.userLocation.location distanceFrom:prox]/1609.334 &lt; (however many miles)){

        annotationView = x;
}
</code></pre>
