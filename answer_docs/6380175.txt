<p>I haven't personally seen the issues you have with a specific monitor not working, but for me (and my Logitech mouse), I have tried the VB6 mouse wheel fix you mentioned and it didn't work.</p>

<p>Instead, I had to use <a href="http://vb.mvps.org/tools/Wheeler/" rel="nofollow">Wheeler</a>.  Check out the link for the full description, but the bottom line is it's the only thing that helps me use the mousewheel in the VB6 IDE on <em>any</em> monitor. </p>
