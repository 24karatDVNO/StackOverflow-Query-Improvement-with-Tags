<p>As @BiggsTRC suggested you can use id to set empid. If not, you can create stored procedure or some PHP code to do that.
If your ID is not "AutoIncrement" field, you can consider a new column as autoincrement field and assign that value to emp with update query and later delete that new column. (These are some alternates, you need to choose the best one)</p>
