<p>Fixed it</p>

<pre><code>Context context = getApplicationContext();
CharSequence text = "Clock is running - create some pause code";
int duration = Toast.LENGTH_LONG;
</code></pre>

<p>Was the guilty code.  Relocated it inside the button onClick listener.  That's just temporary code for testing something anyway.</p>

<p>Thanks for all the help again guys.  I now know more about Java and stack traces than I did yesterday :)</p>
