<p>I just got a Nokia device S60 whit Symbian release 5 here at work, and I'm trying to get the cell phone location based on the cell id, not the gps. So, for that, I use <a href="http://www.opencellid.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.opencellid.org/</a>, this page retrieves me the position, but it is not exactly such as the gps'. But, for doing that I need the mnc, the mcc, the cellid, and the lac, and for my surprise, this device is not giving me the lac, mnc and mcc, such lalchetian said. We have a serious problem, here. It might be that these properties are only available in some devices only.</p>
