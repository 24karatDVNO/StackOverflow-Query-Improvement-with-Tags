<p>This is not possible with the standard methods of the navigation view helper, which is unfortunate, because it is a common case.</p>

<p>However there are some case issues that the ZF developers should have in mind, probably that is why it is not implemented.
Such case is if you want to show non-active branches to the second level.</p>

<pre><code>Item 1 - active
  Item 1.1 - active
    Item 1.1.1 - active
    Item 1.1.2
  Item 1.2
Item 2
  Item 2.1
  Item 2.2
</code></pre>

<p>You may also wish to have other case, show only main items, and only the active branch.</p>

<pre><code>Item 1 - active
  Item 1.1 - active
    Item 1.1.1 - active
    Item 1.1.2
Item 2
</code></pre>

<p>I had that solved with rendering the whole menu and hiding the non-active branches with CSS.</p>

<p>But you may wish to limit your markup so you have to make your custom renderer.</p>
