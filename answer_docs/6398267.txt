<p>I used the jquery-jvert-tabs plugin for something very similar.  Each tab had its content dynamically loaded and the whole div was called via ajax, it worked pretty well together.  </p>

<p>Talking about which one is prettier, it doesn't matter whichever you choose if you just make sure is cohesive with your overall design :)</p>
