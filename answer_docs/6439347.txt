<p>In IE browsers, the answer is YES!</p>

<p>I've done a benchmark (similar to Mike Blandford) and found out that
when you call document.getElementById() in IE browser, it traverses the DOM until it finds an element with desired id, instead of keeping an id-to-element map/hashtable. (hideous, I know).</p>

<p>Thus, creating an array, as you offered will be an EXTREME performance improvement.</p>
