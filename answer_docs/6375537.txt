<p>That's due to the definition of post-increment operator.</p>

<p><strong>post-increment</strong> operator: Increments <em>AFTER</em> the value is used.</p>

<p><strong>pre-increment</strong> operator: Increments <em>BEFORE</em> the value is used.</p>

<p>So if you do it your way, the value returned from the function is the incremented one.</p>

<p>The tutorials increment the object itself, but return a non incremented <em>COPY</em> of the object.</p>
