<p>Virtual table you've created is designed to provide full text queries. It's not aimed to fast processing standard queries using PK in where condition.
In this case there is no index on your _id column, so SQLite probably performs full table scan.
Next problem is your query - it's totally inefficient. Try something like this (untested):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM dictionary WHERE _id = (select max(_id) from dictionary where _id &lt; ?)
</code></pre>

<p>Next thing you can consider is redesign of your app. Instead of loading 1 row you, maybe you should get let's say 40, load them into memory and make background data loading when there is less than n to one of the ends. Long SQL operation will become invisible to user even if it'll last 3s instead of 0,3s</p>
