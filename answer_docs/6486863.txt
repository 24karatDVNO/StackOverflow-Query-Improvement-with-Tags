<p>Bash really isn't the best language for this kind of task. While possible, ild highly recommend the use of perl, python, or tcl for this.</p>

<p>That said, you can write all of stdin from input to a temporary file with shell redirection. Then, use a command like grep to output matches to another file. It might look something like this.</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

cat &gt; temp

grep pattern1 &gt; file1
grep pattern2 &gt; file2
grep pattern3 &gt; file3

rm -f temp
</code></pre>

<p>Then run it like this:</p>

<pre><code>cat file_to_process | ./script.sh
</code></pre>

<p>I'll leave the specifics of the pattern matching to you. </p>
