<p>A service normally runs under a user other than the logged in user therefore the service doesn't have a desktop available to display any windows form, hence the reason t isn't being displayed. </p>

<p>I think you will need to find another way as although a winforms app can start a service I dont believe it can be done the other way around.</p>
