<p>Probably not with code, but you could try this: Open &quot;Automator&quot; (in the Utilities folder) and chose &quot;Folder Action&quot;. As Input folder, you specify the directory of the documents (/Users/student/Library/Application Support/iPhone/Simulator/User/Applications/...) and then you select, from &quot;Files &amp; Folders&quot;, &quot;Duplicate Finder Items&quot; and &quot;Move Finder Items&quot; and select the Desktop. Hit &quot;Save&quot;, give it a name, and all files in the documents folder should be copied to the desktop.</p>
