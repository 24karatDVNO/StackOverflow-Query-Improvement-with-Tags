<p>A slight alternative to JosephStyons answer in case you don't prefer an inline query inside a case statement. </p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    CASE 
        WHEN ig.Guid IS NOT NULL THEN 'Invalid'
        WHEN [SomeColumn] = '2322' THEN 'No'
        ELSE 'Yes'
    END AS [Test]
FROM 
     YourTable yt
     LEFT JOIN INVALID_GUIDS ig
     ON yt.SomeColumn = ig.GUID
</code></pre>
