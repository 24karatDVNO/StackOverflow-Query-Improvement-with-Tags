<p>I know you don't want to use qs variables, but you could do the following.  Create a unique key on page load, store your variables in Application Cache by that key, and stick that key as a querystring variable on you script reference, then access that information from Application Cache again.  This is assuming that you're concerned about security or data size as the reason for now sticking directly in the querystring.</p>
