<p>While it will be difficult at first to change the way you're outputting the data (because it sounds that you are currently manually outputting the data in an HTML table, then using Javascript to sort the table dynamically), but in the long run using a different jQuery plugin altogether, <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=6" rel="nofollow">JQGrid</a>.</p>

<p>From a cursory glance, it looks as if it has a "plugin" of its own that takes a pre-existing table and converts it to a jqgrid, but I've only ever used Jqgrid to make grids from the ground up.</p>

<p>If you're not sure, take a look at their <a href="http://trirand.com/blog/jqgrid/jqgrid.html" rel="nofollow">demo</a> to see it in action.  I think once you see the power that jqgrid provides, you'll consider letting it do the heavy lifting for you.</p>
