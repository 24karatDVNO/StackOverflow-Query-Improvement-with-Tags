<p>This is an array of objects. An array is like a list, so this would be a list of objects. Each object has two properties: Name and ReleaseYear. I'm not sure where your data is coming from, but try something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var movies = new Array();
$.each(result, function(key, value){
    movies.push({Name: this.name, ReleaseYear:this.year})        
});
</code></pre>
