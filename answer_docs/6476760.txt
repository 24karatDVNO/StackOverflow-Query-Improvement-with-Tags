<p>This functions behaves as you want it to:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE FUNCTION some_user_name_stuff(_P12_USERNAME varchar) RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
  user_name_not_found boolean;
BEGIN
  SELECT count(*) = 0 INTO user_name_not_found
  FROM benutzer
  WHERE username=_P12_USERNAME;

  IF (user_name_not_found) THEN
    raise EXCEPTION 'BEREITS_VORHANDEN'; 
  END IF; 
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't do it this way unless the missing username is an exceptional case, i.e. you really expect it to be there. Just use a boolean function. Furthermore, try not to nest function calls inside conidtional statements, it makes an already too verbose langauge even less readable.</p>

<p>Enjoy! :)</p>
