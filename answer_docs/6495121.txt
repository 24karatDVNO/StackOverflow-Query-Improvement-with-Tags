<p>The short answer is that it depends which version of PeopleTools you are on.</p>

<p>If you're reasonably current any component of PeopleSoft can be exposed using a Web Service.  This way you can add/update/retrieve any data that you like.  Also, if you're after a larger dump of data (which it sounds like you are) then you can expose a Query as a Web Service - so you could create a query to extract all open listings and make it available outside of PeopleSoft.</p>
