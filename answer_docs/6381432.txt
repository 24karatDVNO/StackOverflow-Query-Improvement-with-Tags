<p>There was actually a serious security bug, fixed in Drupal 7.1 and 7.2. See the section <strong>Access bypass in File module</strong> in <a href="http://drupal.org/node/1168756" rel="nofollow">SA-CORE-2011-001 - Drupal core - Multiple vulnerabilities</a>.</p>

<p>My Drupal installation is at 7.2. I use the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/content_access" rel="nofollow">Content Access</a> module to control access to individual nodes. If I set the access control so that a node is viewable only by authenticated users, then an attached private file (in my case, an image field) is also visible only to authenticated users. An anonymous user cannot access the file by giving the <a href="http://example.com/system/files/some-image.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://example.com/system/files/some-image.jpg</a> directly. If I make the node viewable by anyone, then that URL becomes directly accessible again.</p>

<p>You are using <a href="http://drupal.org/project/field_permissions" rel="nofollow">Field Permissions</a>, not <a href="http://drupal.org/project/content_access" rel="nofollow">Content Access</a>. I haven't tested that case, but you can upgrade to 7.1 or 7.2 and see if it does work after that.</p>
