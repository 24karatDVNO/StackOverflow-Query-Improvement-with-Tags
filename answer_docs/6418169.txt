<p>It looks like the compiler was having problems infering the correct type. Instead of using the class returned by the LINQ2SQL context, it was using the base class, so I had to cast it to the correct type explicitly.</p>

<p>This previous example does NOT work:</p>

<pre><code>result = from c in dataContext.ConcreteClasses where c.Foo == 42 select c;
</code></pre>

<p>This example does work:</p>

<pre><code>result = from c in dataContext.ConcreteClasses where ((ConcreteClass)c).Foo == 42 select c;
</code></pre>

<p>Odd, but it works. Upvotes to anyone who can figure out why it would do that.</p>
