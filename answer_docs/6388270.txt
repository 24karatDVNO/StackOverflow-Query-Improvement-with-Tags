<p>I would recommend writing a custom directive for it (see <code>freemarker.template.TemplateDirectiveModel</code>), so in your templates you can write something like <code>&lt;@my.textAsHtml springMacroRequestContext.getMessage(...) /&gt;</code>. It's important that this is a directive, not function, so it works properly inside <code>&lt;#escape x as x?html&gt;...&lt;/#escape&gt;</code>. Otherwise it would be double-escaped. Using a directive can also give the highest performance, as you can directly send the output to the output <code>Writer</code>, rather than building a <code>String</code> first.</p>
