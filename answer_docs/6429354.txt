<p>If you need a complete guide to getting rolling with Rails under Ubuntu, you can find a short guide here: <a href="http://blog.dcxn.com/2011/06/21/rolling-with-rails-3-on-ubuntu-11-04/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.dcxn.com/2011/06/21/rolling-with-rails-3-on-ubuntu-11-04/</a></p>

<p>The gist is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Install RVM (The Ruby version manager)</li>
<li>Install Rails from gem</li>
<li>Get going with Rails</li>
</ol>

<p>It's a simple process but there are a few things you need to do for it to be completely smooth like making sure you have the pre-requisites for rvm installed via apt before install rvm.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
