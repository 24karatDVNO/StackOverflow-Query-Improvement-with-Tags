<p>Figured it out and used the retry statement. the if statement now looks like this (all other variables have been edited to be non-global as well)</p>

<pre><code>if lname[i] == lname.last 
  santas = Array.new
  giftfname = fname.clone
  giftlname = lname.clone
  giftemail = email.clone
  retry  
</code></pre>

<p>That, aside from a few other edits, created the solution I needed without breaking apart the code too much again. Will definitely try out mu's solution as well, but I'm just glad I have this running error-free for now.</p>
