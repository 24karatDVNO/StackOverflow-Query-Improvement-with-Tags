<p>Wow, I can't believe this is happening.</p>

<p>The line &lt;% form_for(@source, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |f| %> should be &lt;%= form_for(@source, :html => { :multipart => true }) do |f| %> (with an equals sign).</p>

<p>This bug took me forEVER to figure out.</p>

<p>Why doesn't RoR give me a warning or something?! Can someone give me some tips to help prevent this from happening again?</p>
