<p>I would be careful using fb://profile/1234567890 as when I tested it, it only worked if a user has previously opened the page on their phone from the Facebook app. If they hadn't it would return a blank page.   It's also not documented anywhere by Facebook so they may break it in the future without any notice.  That was also the only url I could get to work, not any kind of name. So if you are going to use this method, just grab the id easily from the fan page by going to <a href="http://graph.facebook.com/pagename" rel="nofollow">http://graph.facebook.com/pagename</a></p>
