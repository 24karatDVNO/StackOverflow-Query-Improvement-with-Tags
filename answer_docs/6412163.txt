<p>Instead of <code>{name: something1, status: up}, {name: something2, status: down}</code>, which is not valid JSON, I recommend targeting an array structure, such as <code>[{name: something1, status: up}, {name: something2, status: down}]</code>.  So, you'd build this with <code>net.sf.json.JSONArray</code>, adding <code>JSONObjects</code>, built similarly to what you've already got.  Of course, you'd need to change it to make two different <code>JSONObjects</code>, each of which would have the elements "name" and "status" added only once each.</p>
