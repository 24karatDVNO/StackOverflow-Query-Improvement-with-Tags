<p>My experience with <a href="http://flowplayer.org/tools/scrollable/index.html" rel="nofollow">jquery tools scrollable</a> has been very good and I recommend all jquery tools anytime.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: While I don't completely understand your exact use case, the scrollable plugin is very flexible and does not come in the way.</p>
