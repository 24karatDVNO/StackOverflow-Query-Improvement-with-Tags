<p>Why don't you just upgrade BlogEngine to Asp.net 4.0 ?</p>

<p>Download the BE 2.0 Web version open it up in Visual Studio it will ask "Would you like it 4.0?" Say yes then it targets the web.config for you.</p>

<p>You can then just upload the new web.config to your server.</p>

<p>If you have an old BE version then you might want to upgrade it to the last stable release.</p>
