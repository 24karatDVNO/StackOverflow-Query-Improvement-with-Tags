<p>The choice of left/right is completely arbitrary, but once you make it you have to stick with it.  After all, you could just take your heap, draw a picture of it, then mirror it and it would still be a valid heap.  The underlying reason for this is that you can take any program, and swap all occurrences of the variables left and right, and the resulting program will still be valid, and moreover do exactly the same thing.</p>
