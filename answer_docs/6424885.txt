<p>I don't delete this question just in case anyone fall in the same trouble.</p>

<p>The problem is the browser sending the path like <code>C:\fakepath\</code> which in execution time, and after converting to XML it states  <code>\f</code> .</p>

<p>You can set up this behavior in  you browser.</p>

<p>Regards.</p>
