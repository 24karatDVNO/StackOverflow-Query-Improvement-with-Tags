<p>There are 3 possible ways, that I know if, to get around this:</p>

<p>1) Dont use Acrobat and provide your own interface (might be a good idea if web based)</p>

<p>2) Look for an off-the-shelf solution</p>

<p>3) Open Acrobat/Reader from your own application (ie not within the same interface/form) and try to detect changes to the file.</p>
