<p>I would say it depends on your users. I have bought licenses and used FOSS .NET libraries. Some have had installers, and some have simply been files zipped up.</p>

<p>It's a tough balance but you need to weigh the ability of your users. Will they appreciate ease of use with an installer or the flexibility of files.</p>

<p>Personally I prefer skipping the installer, simplifies the process of support and management. No need to worry about uninstallers or how future versions of various OS's will impact things.</p>
