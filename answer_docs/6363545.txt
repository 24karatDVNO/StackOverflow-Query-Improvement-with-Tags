<p>You could use something like this (sintax depends on db engine):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT DISCTINCT column
FROM
   ( 
    SELECT column1 as column FROM table
    UNION
    SELECT column2 as column FROM table
   )
ORDER BY column ASC
</code></pre>

<p>Refer to you dbms manual to check sintax on UNION clause</p>
