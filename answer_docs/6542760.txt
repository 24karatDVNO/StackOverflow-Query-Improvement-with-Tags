<p>Try putting Date as Category Field, IssuesFixed as Data Field, and TechnicianType as the Series Field.  Then you will have two progress lines, one for Engineer and Sr. Engineer, with Date on the horizontal axis, IssuesFixed on the vertical axis.  If you want to filter for individual names, or for any other variable, right-click on the 'variable/box' you want to filter in the Data Field, and select Filter on the left pane of the dialog, and set your filter there.</p>
