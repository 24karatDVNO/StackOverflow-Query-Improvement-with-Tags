<p>In case you are having this issue when working with WordPress control panel and using a ThemeRoller generated theme - be sure that you are using 1.7.3 Version of theme, 1.8.13 will not work. (If you look closely, the element is being rendered, but .ui-helper-hidden-accessible is causing it to not be displayed. </p>
