<p>Actually all current, modern browsers interpret CSS very similarly based on the standards. It's usally only IE (6, 7, 8) that make problems, especially if your HTML documents don't trigger Standards-Mode, thus:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write your pages based on current HTML and CSS standards with a DOCTYPE.</li>
<li>For support of older IE, give them separate style sheets using Conditional Comments.</li>
<li>If there are differences between other browsers, there are usually workarounds. Ask abotu specific problems here or in your favorite CSS forum/group/list.</li>
</ol>
