<p>I recently wrote a script to help us solve this problem - it's not complete source control by any stretch, but it's just a single stored procedure that stores the history of your database objects in a table - you can schedule it using the SQL Agent to run as often as you want.</p>

<p>While it will take snapshots at a point in time, it doesn't really support check-ins, but it has saved our bacon a few times when a stored proc gets dropped or changed without a backup, and the previous version is easily restored.</p>
