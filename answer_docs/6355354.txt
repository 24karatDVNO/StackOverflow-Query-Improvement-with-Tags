<p>if my understanding of your question is correct, you wanted to display different help screens for differnt elements,
o.k here it is, if the message of the screen is displayed as a tool tip and the styling is taken care by mouseover event
selenium.mouseOver(locator) and then [ Thread.sleep(1000) ] and then use
selenium.mouseOut(locator)
 try with this.if you don't get it and if my understanding of your question is wrong please post it.</p>

<p>you must investigate how that screen is being is displayed. and try to post all that code</p>
