<p>It is quite simple. How is a regular language generated? By an dfa (deterministic finite automate).</p>

<p>You can use dfa not just for checking if a word is in a language L but also for generate all words from L. This is done by traversing the graph recursive. Potenially L can contain infinite  words so the traversing algorithm runs also endlessly. But in case you found a word you increment a counter. And when you finally reach your 5 words you break it.</p>
