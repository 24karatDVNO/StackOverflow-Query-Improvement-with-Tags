<p>Honestly, the best option for this is to use the concept of database migrations, which came from the Ruby world, if I'm not mistaken.  I have used a framework called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/migratordotnet/" rel="nofollow">Migrator.Net</a> in my applications, but there are a bunch of really good ones (with varying levels of activity) that basically do the same thing.  A quick Google search turns up <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=c#%20database%20migrations" rel="nofollow">quite a few</a>.</p>
