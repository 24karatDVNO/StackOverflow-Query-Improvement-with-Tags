<p>Perhaps you could use a naming convention to help you remember which is which: </p>

<pre><code>char *str[10];
char *str_p[10];

str[i]="Hi";

str_p[k]=strdup("hi");
</code></pre>

<p>(or use a structure with a pointer and a flag which indicates that this particular pointer was dynamically allocated)</p>
