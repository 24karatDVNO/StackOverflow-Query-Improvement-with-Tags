<p>@sasquatch @YuzaKen @MishieMoo If I simply set self.pageImage = nil; in the dealloc, as you suggested, won't that only release the memory when a user leaves the ViewController?</p>

<p>I feel like I need to be releasing the UIImageViews as I move down the rows of the array, when I replace the contents of the UIImageView with a new image, no?</p>
