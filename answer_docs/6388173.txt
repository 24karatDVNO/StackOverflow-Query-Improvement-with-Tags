<p>Setting <code>riskType</code> inside your function is local to that function and will not affect the value in the global.  You need to tell your function to use the global by putting <code>global riskType</code> before code that tries to modify it.  </p>

<p><code>None</code> should be capitalized.  </p>

<p>I believe you meant to set riskType to a string and therefore those values should be quoted.</p>

<p>Python has an <code>elif</code> for <code>else if</code>.</p>

<p>The corrected code:</p>

<pre><code># Global Variables
riskCode = 0
estimatePrice = 0
riskType = None

def defineType(riskCode):
    global riskType
    if riskCode == 1:
        riskType = "High"
    elif riskCode == 2:
        riskType = "Moderate"
    elif riskCode == 3:
        riskType = "Low"
    elif RiskCode == 4:
        riskType = "No"
</code></pre>
