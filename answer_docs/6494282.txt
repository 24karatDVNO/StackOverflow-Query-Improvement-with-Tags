<p>It looks like you are using Python 3.X judging by the <code>open</code> command used.  What you have should work, although you may need to define the <code>newline</code> parameter as well.  <code>newline=''</code> will use the native line ending (CRLF on Windows, for example), but Yahoo may have other requirements.  The code below generated the file correctly on Windows with CRLF line endings.</p>

<pre><code>data = [
    ['One','Two','Three'],
    [1,2,3],
    [4,5,6],
    [7,8,9]]

import csv
f = open('new_yahoo.csv','w', newline='', encoding='utf-16-le')
writer = csv.writer(f, delimiter='\t')
writer.writerows(data)
f.close()
</code></pre>
