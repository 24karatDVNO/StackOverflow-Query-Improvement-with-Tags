<p>A basic merge sort sorts your array, so you easily get the biggest and smallest numbers. But you're just trying to modify the array so that you only get the biggest and smallest numbers -- you don't care about the ones in the middle. They're effectively garbage, once you identify them.</p>

<p>How can you identify if a number you're looking at is useless? Well, if it's the case that it's both not the smallest and not the biggest number in your current scope.</p>

<p>Start by looking at the psuedo-code for merge sort. What are the smallest changes you can make to more closely solve this problem?</p>
