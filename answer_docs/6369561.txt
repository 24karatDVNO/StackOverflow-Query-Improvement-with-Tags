<p>You can simply hard-code text and linked images in your tpl.php file(s).
Just put html block with desired code in tpl.php after menu. Make new wraper around menu &amp; block if current html structure of your theme is not supporting this solution. Block should be floated right or displayed inline depending on HTML+CSS of your theme.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
