<p>If you were to use a <a href="http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com" rel="nofollow">Guava</a> <a href="http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release09/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Table.html" rel="nofollow">Table</a> rather than a <code>Collection&lt;Collection&lt;T&gt;&gt;</code>, you'd be able to use <a href="http://guava-libraries.googlecode.com/svn/tags/release09/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Tables.html#transpose%28com.google.common.collect.Table%29" rel="nofollow">Tables.transpose</a> to create a view of the table with row keys and column keys switched. Of course, you'd need to deal with keys for your rows and columns (integers probably) rather than just not having row or column keys at all.</p>
