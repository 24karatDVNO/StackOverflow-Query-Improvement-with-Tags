<p>The proper way to handle this is to use an HTML form and a server based form processor.  This requires a little bit of coding knowledge.  Based on your question, it doesn't sound like you have a lot of experience with server-side coding-- May I suggest one of the many server side plugins that will process the form and email you the results? <a href="http://www.tectite.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tectite.com/</a> has PHP FormMail which is easy to use and configure.</p>

<p>As has been stated above, you can't force a browser to open an email client-- Furthermore many users use gmail, hotmail, yahoo mail and may use the browser as their client.  Your solution would exclude a large segment of users from responding!</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
