<p>CoreData is the most commonly used data store but it all depends. For instance if you have lots of PDF's you wish to download then you wouldn't put those in CoreData per se, but you would save the files to the users documents directory and commonly add the details (name, path etc) in CoreData for fast retrieval.</p>

<p>For more normal data such as customer details, addresses etc then you can use CoreData to easily go from your domain layer (Customer Object, Address Object) to a persistent store.</p>

<p>CoreData is worth the reading in my opinion. If you want a quick start then I have sample code which includes a Storage Service in the code for this <a href="http://www.locassa.com/index.php/2011/05/temporary-storage-in-apples-coredata/" rel="nofollow">article.</a> Feel free to use it / hack it apart / let me know your thoughts on it! ;) Good luck!</p>
