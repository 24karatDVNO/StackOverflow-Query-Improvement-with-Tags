<h2>Flex</h2>

<p>I strongly recommend you use Flex because <strong>you need</strong> a clear cross platform, cross browser RIA (Rich Internet Application) solution.</p>

<p>I can give you some useful reasons..</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Even if Flex and Flash share some common aspects in background, Flex lacks some loop-holes which Flash have. Your site design and layout is 100% safe with Flex.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Flex has predefined functions and classes that enable us to read or synchronize data perfectly. These predefined functions and classes will work for us automatically so that we can focus on animation and interactivity. First, try to use it and see the difference. Personally, I am using Adobe Flex as tool to create RIA (Rich Internet applications).</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> I have kept a function in flash to real XML file and parse it to next or previous record and I was passing this function once needed. Now and with Flex, we have predefined http classes that will work after passing URL.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> RIAs developed into Adobe Flex is the cross browser and platform compatibility. Rich internet application developed in Flash player.Implementation of Flex player made the Adobe Flash Player to more and more userâ€™s machine.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> Adobe Flex product family helps IT organizations take advantage of existing skills and infrastructure to efficiently deliver a broad range of RIAs that can scale from simple marketing applications to mission-critical enterprise applications.</p>
