<p>Javascript variables are not declared with a type, and you cannot ask for an array of String, because Javascript only has one kind of array, which holds anything. Also, make sure your brackets balance. Finally, array indices in Javascript start at 0, just like in most other programming languages (including Java, which you seem to be getting confused with - but Java and Javascript have nothing to do with each other, despite the names).</p>

<pre><code>var arr1 = [];
arr1[0]="whatever";
arr1[1]="ksj";
$.each( arr1, function(i, l){ 
   alert( "Index #" + i + ": " + l );
});
</code></pre>
