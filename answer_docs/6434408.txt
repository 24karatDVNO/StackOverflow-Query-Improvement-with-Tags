<p>I'm not sure if this will fix your problem because I haven't tested it, but I notice that your first <code>break;</code> statement is in a different spot than the other two:</p>

<pre><code>// 1st for loop
for (i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    if (...) {
        // ...
    }
    break;
}

// 2nd and 3rd for loops
for (i = 1; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    if (...) {
        // ...
        break;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of the first <code>for</code> loop, the break statement will execute immediately on the first loop, causing it to exit the loop on the first iteration, always.  In the case of the second and third loops, you only execute the break statement when you satisfy the condition of the <code>if</code> statement and enter that control block.</p>
