<p>What about if you <a href="http://www.apple.com/quicktime/download/" rel="nofollow">download QuickTime Player 7</a> and use that instead? It wont replace QuickTime Player X and has many features that X does not (although you'll need a pro serial number to access some of the features from the GUI). Apple still make this version available for a good reason!</p>

<p>Alternatively, if you've got as far as writing some Obj-C code, you could go one step further and access the metadata directly, as illustrated <a href="http://www.mactech.com/articles/mactech/Vol.21/21.10/TheInformer/index.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
