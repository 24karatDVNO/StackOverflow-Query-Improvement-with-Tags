<p>Old topic, but wanted to add <strong><a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/ORM/" rel="nofollow">XPO</a></strong> from <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Developer Express</a>.</p>

<p>It's pretty mature now, it's been around for a while and recently got lots of new features.
It's also the underlying ORM for <a href="http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Application_Framework/" rel="nofollow">XAF</a>, Developer Express' application framework.</p>

<p><strong>XPO</strong> Supports both <code>.mdb</code> and the new <code>.accdb</code> Access files (and lots of other drivers), has linq support, supports client/server scenarios, allows execution of SQL if you so require, etc.</p>

<p>If you stay generic and don't call db-specific features, you can just change the connection string and use another database without changing another line of code.<br>
Great for planning ahead so you can switch away from an Access DB if you need later on...</p>
