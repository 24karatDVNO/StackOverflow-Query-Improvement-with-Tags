<p>As a UI developer who gets paid to worry about box model and IE incompatibilities, I'm going to always answer the question of "what can auto-generate layouts?" with one simple answer: nothing.  There's no replacement for a good UI developer, especially with Microsoft out there making up the game as they go along....IE is the reason that people like me can stay gainfully employed.</p>

<p>That being said, the closest thing to an auto design tool I can think of is a grid generator.  This is my weapon of choice:  <a href="http://www.gridsystemgenerator.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gridsystemgenerator.com/</a></p>

<p>There are tools out there that generate fairly acceptable code....Apple's web design tool comes to mind.  But every major project that ends up in my office that's done in tools like Apple's design software, Adobe's new Web Catalyst, Dreamweaver (proprietary coding tools anyways) ends up getting redone.  Why?  Because I haven't found a single one that both supports the box model issues AND generates perfectly w3 compliant HTML.....after all, that's the standard we all are here to live by.</p>
