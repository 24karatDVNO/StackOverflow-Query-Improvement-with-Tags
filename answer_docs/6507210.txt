<p><a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elemhidehelper/" rel="nofollow">Element Hiding Helper</a> (requires Adblock Plus) does something like what you are asking for. It allows you to select an element (simple clicking won't do because sometimes you need to select the parent element) and then to choose the attributes/elements that you want to include in the selector. It then proceeds by adding the selector to Adblock Plus - but that step is optional.</p>
