<p>PHP 1 was built originally by Rasmus.<br>
Two Israely students came by, saw it is good and re-wrote the entire thing. and then re-wrote it again and again (this time with a lot of help of the community) Zend 2,3,4 and 5...  </p>

<p>Their names are ZEev and aNDy -> ZEND. and PHP is was built on top of their original engine, which is called by their name (if you have not guessed so by now). 
It will probably remain like that out of respect and due to the fact they still contribute, either by putting in resources from ZEND the company or personally.  </p>

<p>That is why you see in php.ini and all through the core of PHP the word ZEND. Nothing to do with ZF.</p>
