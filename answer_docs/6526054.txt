<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/j4QgN/1/" rel="nofollow"><strong>This demo</strong></a> should do what you want. I changed the selector to create a more traditional <a href="http://api.jquery.com/mouseenter/" rel="nofollow"><code>.mouseenter()</code></a>, <a href="http://api.jquery.com/mouseleave/" rel="nofollow"><code>.mouseleave()</code></a>  combination. If you need the <code>delay()</code>   it can be added back. The demo is working with and without it for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://api.jquery.com/stop/" rel="nofollow"><code>.stop()</code></a> tends to be called before calling an animation effect, thereby stopping a running animation before starting another.</p>
