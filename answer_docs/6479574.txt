<p>I was also researching a related problem. It appears that the in-memory schema does not persist across sessions: <a href="http://vageeshhoskere.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/unit-test-with-junit-for-hibernate-using-hsqldb-in-memory/" rel="nofollow">http://vageeshhoskere.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/unit-test-with-junit-for-hibernate-using-hsqldb-in-memory/</a></p>

<p>So, either you can do what needs to be done in a single session (which is rather limiting), or attempt the file version of hsqldb</p>
