<p>You can "shelve" your changes in subversion, commit, and then take your changes back off the shelf into your working directory.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://markphip.blogspot.com/2007/01/shelves-in-subversion.html" rel="nofollow">http://markphip.blogspot.com/2007/01/shelves-in-subversion.html</a> for details.</p>

<p>Be sure to read the entire post and understand what's going on (pay special attention to the "better method" section). Shelving isn't a "feature" of Subversion, but it's still possible.</p>
