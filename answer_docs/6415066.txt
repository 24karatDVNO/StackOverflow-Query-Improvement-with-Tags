<p>It depends on what platform / OS you are trying to do that on:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you are using a RTOS on embedded device, you may be able to change the code directly in there too...</li>
<li>If you are on Linux, you may be able to find the code somewhere and change it there to recompile, but you may have a pretty serious performance impact on your platform.</li>
<li>For others, you can use a wrapper in your application, call it "os_malloc" or something like that and implement that function for any debugging or anything like that.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last one is probably your safest bet no matter what...</p>
