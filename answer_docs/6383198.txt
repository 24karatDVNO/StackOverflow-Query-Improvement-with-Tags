<p>well your list view has an adapter. to populate your adapter you are using some sort of an array( of strings, objects etc..) so you need a variable that will track the position of the view in the grid starting from 0 and incrementing with each button click. on the button click before you increment the position you need to change the text of the items array for the adapter on the relevant position and call notifyDataSetChanged() on your adapter. that's it.</p>
