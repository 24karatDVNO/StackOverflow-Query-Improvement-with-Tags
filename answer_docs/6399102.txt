<p>I personally use <a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/" rel="nofollow">VMWare Workstation</a>. It has never given me problems. I'd recommend it.</p>

<p>In terms of what there is available out there, there is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_platform_virtual_machines" rel="nofollow">ridiculous amount</a> of programs to choose from.</p>

<p>There are my two cents! Hope this helps and good luck!</p>
