<p>This can be done with wget (http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/). </p>

<p>Ex: wget -nc --page-requisites --domains mysubsite.mysite.com --no-parent mysubsite.mysite.com/Folder1/Folder2/ mysubsite.mysite.com/Folder1/Folder2/</p>

<p>-nc is no-clobber, meaning any existing files will not be overwritten
--page-requisites will grab anything necessary for proper page viewing (css files, etc)
--domains mysubsite.mysite.com will not follow any links outside of mysubsite.mysite.com
--no-parent: don't follow links outside the directory /Folder1/Folder2/</p>

<p>Edit: Just re-read your question- I don't think you'd want to use the recursive flag. Stick with --no-parent and that will allow you to get everything in the /Folder1/Folder2/ directory.</p>

<p>HTH</p>
