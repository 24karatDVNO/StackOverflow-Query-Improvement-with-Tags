<p>Perhaps you could create an error interface like IErrorHandler and pass that into a public method called Validate on you model class assuming its a partial  class and you can seperate your data model from your rules.</p>

<p>With the interface you could create a class in your contoller that wraps the ModelState error handler. So the inteface might have AddError and in that metghod tou just delegate to your local modelstate.</p>

<p>So your method might be something like:</p>

<pre><code>IErrorHandler errorHandler = CreateErrorHandler();
model.Validate(errorHandler);

if(errorHandler.IsValid())
... do something
</code></pre>
