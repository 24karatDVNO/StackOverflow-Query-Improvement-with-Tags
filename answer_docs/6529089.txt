<p><a href="http://www.razuna.org/" rel="nofollow">Razuna</a> looks quite good, I'm looking for a similar solution - though i probably won't have trillions of textures files or something, I do have loads of .psd/.ai/.indd formats, which a number of systems offer thumbnail preview to a certain degree.</p>

<p>One thing to look out for is whether the system can handle/use/manipulate <a href="http://www.iptc.org/site/Home/" rel="nofollow">IPTC</a> metadata, basically what this means is when metadata is embedded in an asset, the system can present that to you in a digestable format. An example of this is Google's Picassa which allows search indexing on this data. Also a number of stock asset sites both use and produce this data in their asset sets - so when you download an image for example, it comes pre-tagged with "woman, standing, smiling, photo, office" so you only have to add your own tags on top, for example "telecoms project, overview module".</p>

<p>Again, if you're generating a swathe of files from your output then it may depend on the nature of your file output as to what kind of versioning/management you need?</p>

<p>If, for example, you have output that is made up of a bunch of source files, some of which are program-specific and some of which are linked assets, then you might want to put the whole lot under version control (<a href="http://www.plasticscm.com" rel="nofollow">PlasticSCM</a> or Subversion perhaps) and "exclude" graphic files by their file type. Then, use something like Razuna to upload, hold and display your graphic files.</p>

<p>I noticed with Razuna that you can organise things by category, and assign multiple categories - that is, you have 1 set of files but multiple views of them. That's why I liked Razuna, though to be honest the demo crapped out but it could've been because I changed email and profile data half way through the trial.</p>

<p>Interested to know how you go in your search and what you've found to be useful!</p>
