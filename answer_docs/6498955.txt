<p>Is JOGL on a Maven repository ? You should upload it to yours if it's not publicly available.</p>

<p>Then it's the usual:</p>

<pre><code># Example of artifact definition, granted that JOGL's group id jogl, 
# and the artifact id is jogl.
#
# I put up 1.0 as version too. 
JOGL = "jogl:jogl:jar:1.0"

...
compile.using JOGL
</code></pre>

<p>You can also install JOGL locally and point to it:  </p>

<pre><code>compile.using _("lib/*")
</code></pre>
