<p>I think you might need to append the terminating "0" to your data.</p>

<p>From one of my projects:</p>

<pre><code>- (void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection
{
   char temp[] = {0};
   [receivedData appendBytes:temp length:1];

   // etc your usual code here
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then perform as usual with the correct encoding.</p>
