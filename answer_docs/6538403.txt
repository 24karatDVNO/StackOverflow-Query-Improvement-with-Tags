<p>Many developers think that making a design / model, in U.M.L. or other, will stay. Changing a diagram its very frecuent. Some developers skip updating the diagram, after the initial versions, due to time &amp; resources restrictions.</p>

<p>My suggestion is that you should get used to the idea, that crafting a Software App. is complex, and its going to change very frecuently, not like a building where, architects make their U.M.L ("blueprint"), and once the program ("building") its designed based in that U.M.L., it going to stay that way.</p>

<p>Working with several incremental prototype versions, both for Modeling and programming, instead on thinking for a single complex app., could work for your software team.</p>

<p>And to be honest, buildings and their blueprints, changes also, maybe not as frecuent as a Software Applications, but, they do.</p>
