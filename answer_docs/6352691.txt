<p>That's a very broad question.  You could end up writing a whole bunch of code to do something you think is fairly simple.</p>

<p>For a beginner, I suggest you use a <strong>jQuery plugin</strong>.  Then you only have to do some minimal setup and configuration, all the while you can pick it apart to learn how it works.</p>

<p>I like one called <strong><a href="http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/" rel="nofollow">prettyPhoto</a></strong> which does something like what you describe plus a lot more.  If it's not suitable, there are many different jQuery plugins that do nothing but handle thumbnails, galleries, slideshows, light-boxes, and every conceivable combination.</p>
