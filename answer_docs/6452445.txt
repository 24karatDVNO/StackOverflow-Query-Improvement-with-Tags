<p>Depends what your doing - choose the best tool for the job.</p>

<p>If you're doing classic AI (Natural Language Processing, Expert Systems, etc) then languages like Lisp and Prolog are a good fit (the language facilitates easy development), however if you're doing Fuzzy Logic, Neural Networks etc then Java/C++ would be a better choice.</p>

<p>Years ago as an undergrad I wrote some NLP and Expert Systems in Prolog and then repeated the exercise in C++, the Prolog versions were around a third of the size and took about half the time to develop.  I wrote a few Fuzzy Logic and Neural Nets in C++, but never fancied rewriting them in Prolog (I sure that would have been quite painful)  =)</p>
