<p>OSdave had the right answer ... but the way I fixed the error message was I blew away the download folder on the server and re-copied over from the original Magento install package.  </p>

<p>Once I had done that I re-ran the Extension Key in Connect and this time it actually said.  "That Extension is in Alpha stage.  You'll need to change your preferences to install it."</p>

<p>I did NOT get the error above anymore.  At that point everything worked like a charm.</p>
