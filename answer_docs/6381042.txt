<p>One idea is to wrap the ul in a div.  Set the height of the div.  Set the ul/li's to height:100%.  - not sure if this will work.  If you use spans/divs instead of li's it will.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can use javascript after loading to find all the heights then go back through and set the heights to the max found height.</p>
