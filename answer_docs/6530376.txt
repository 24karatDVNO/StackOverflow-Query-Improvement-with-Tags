<li>Exceptions can provide much more data than simple <code>-1</code> or <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Exceptions can do advanced error handling. Keep in mind that <code>try .. catch</code> blocks can be nested and there could be more than one <code>catch</code> block in <code>try .. catch</code> block.</li>
<li><p>Exceptions force you to handle errors. When you're not using them you do something like:</p>

<pre><code>function doSomething($a, $b, $c) {
    ...

    if ($a &lt; $b &amp;&amp; $b &gt; $c) {
        return -1; // error
    }

    ...
}

$d = doSomething($x, $y, $z);

if ($d === -1) {
    die('Fatal error!');
}
</code></pre>

<p>And everything is fine as long as you remember to check whether function returned error. But what happen if you forgot to check that? It's actually a quite common problem.</p></li>
<li><p>Exceptions make the flow of a program much more natural.</p></li>
