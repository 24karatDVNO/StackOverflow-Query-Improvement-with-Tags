<p>Is there any chance to make the call on page load, and use PHP to echo out the data on the server side as the page is built up?  It appears from the AJAX url that is hardcoded/static, as opposed to being dynamically generated as the result of an event handler.  Maybe a cURL request in the beginning?  It would probably be more efficient then modifying the DOM on the client side.</p>
