<p>What happens when you doubleclick the PPS (ie, in Windows Explorer or the Finder)?
If it doesn't launch the presentation in slideshow mode, there's something amiss with the file associations on the computer or PPT/the viewer isn't installed so there's nothing to play the file.</p>

<p>If doubleclicked PPS files play as expected, then it might be a path issue.  I don't know how Flash behaves, but in some apps you can't always assume that the path will be set to the path of the current document or app/exe file.</p>

<p>As a test, try hardcoding the path to the PPS in your EXE.</p>
