<p>You could do it in 1 less-readable line as follows:
<code>Response.Cookies.Add(new HttpCookie("UserID", "JLovus") {Expires = DateTime.Now.AddMinutes(30)});</code></p>

<p>Just because you <em>can</em> do something in less lines of code doesn't mean you <em>should</em> do it that way. Your original code was concise and easily readable. What I (and several other people) posted is harder to understand at a glance.</p>
