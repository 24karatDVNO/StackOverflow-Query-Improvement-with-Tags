<p>I think in you case it will work as you want:</p>

<pre><code>class Seat(db.Model):
    id = db.IntegerProperty()
    roomId = db.ReferenceProperty(Room,collection_name='seats')
</code></pre>

<p>And after that you may use something like this:</p>

<pre><code>rooms = Room.all().order('id')
for room in rooms:
    seat_at_room = room.seats.order('id')
</code></pre>
