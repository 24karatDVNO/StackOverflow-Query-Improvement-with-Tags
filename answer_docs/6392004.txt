<p>It will probably be pretty hard to get the same timeout in your development enviroment. 
You would need to use the same kind of hw and the same load as on the production servers.</p>

<p>The time out is most likely caused by:
1) a dead lock
2) a missing index
3) bad query plan</p>

<p>If you know exactly what parameters (their value) are sent in to the stored proc you could take a look at the query plan using SQL Managemnt studio or simular tools. 
If your running SQL 2008 the query analys will tell you if your missing an index. </p>

<p>If the parameters vary a lot it can be good to force the SQL server to create a new auery plan each time by adding <strong>with recompile</strong> in the stored procedure. </p>

<p>If the query plan looks good and dandy you need to add a trace on the server and look for locks on tables involved in the stored procedure. </p>
