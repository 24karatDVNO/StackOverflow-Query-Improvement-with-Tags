<p>The while true causes a infinite loop to stop the thread terminating, for example you don't want your server that is waiting for clients to connect to only check once then to stop checking, you want the server to keep checking over and over. Using a while loop allows you to <code>break;</code> out the loop if something goes wrong.</p>
