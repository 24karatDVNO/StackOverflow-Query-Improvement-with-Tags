<pre><code>OnCommandSentThatRequiresAWait Event Call SaveStateAndDisableUI()

SaveStateAndDisableUI()
{
   Foreach control in controlsCollection
   {
       switch(controlType)
       {
           for each control extract and save all you need. 
           if it's a menu check if it is opened up and so on, 
           does control have focus, 
           where is the caret located in case of textbox etc              
       }
   }
   save position of mouse x,y
   save position of form, state like if it is minimized, maximized
}

Corresponding RestoreState() should restore everything back up.
