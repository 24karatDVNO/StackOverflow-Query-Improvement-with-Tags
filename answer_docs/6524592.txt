<p>Use Java NIO, it is quite simple and if you will grasp the basics, there would be no real need in all these countless libraries... or anyway you would know their internals. One of the important things however, mentioned here already, is that the game structure has to be adapted for networking from the start. It may be a complete rewrite in the worst case. Basically, you will have to create clients database, socket connections, and from the server side, every connection (represented by a SelectorKey object), should be encapsulated into an object, representing a "joined client". Then read/write operations would be performed to the key's socket. But there is more. The server will have to be the center of your application link, so that you will have to develop an entire network messages protocol for your game (over TCP, there is no need in UDP in this kind of game). Also - read more about the protocols (TCP/UDP/sockets, ethernet), the more you read - the better.</p>

<p>Also! Pay attention to the HTML5 websockets stuff. It is a great thing!!!</p>
