<p>Try out this:</p>

<pre><code>mkrevlst [] = Lin
mkrevlst (x:xs) = Snoc x (mkrevlst xs)
</code></pre>

<p>Snoc constructor need 2 parameters where as you were passing only one i.e x
It will solve the error but it wont solve your problem of creating a output like:</p>

<pre><code>((Lin Snoc 3) Snoc 2) Snoc 1
</code></pre>

<p>For this you need to modify your data structure</p>
