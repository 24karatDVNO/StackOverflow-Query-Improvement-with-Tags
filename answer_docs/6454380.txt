<p>Not shure cause I haven't started Objective-C not to long ago but I would to autoreleas directly when you alloc it.  That will prevent you from having to manage the release and making  the runtime manage the release of it.</p>

<pre><code>- (NSArray *) children
{
NSArray *children = [node objectForKey:TFHppleNodeChildrenKey];
NSMutableArray *hpple = [NSMutableArray arrayWithCapacity:[children count]];
for(NSDictionary *child in children) {
    [hpple addObject:[[[TFHppleElement alloc] initWithNode:child] autorelease]];
    [child release];
}
return hpple;
}
</code></pre>
