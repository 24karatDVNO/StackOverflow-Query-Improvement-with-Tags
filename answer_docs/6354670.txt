<p>C99 and C++0x differ on the meaning of <code>long long int</code>. (There is no <code>long long int</code> in C++ 2003, although many vendors do supply it.) C99 is very specific: long long int is at least 64 bits. C++0x is incredibly vague: sizeof(long long int) >= sizeof(long int) >= sizeof(int) >= sizeof(short int) >= sizeof(signed char). The only one with special meaning is int, which is the most natural size for the execution environment.</p>
