<p>I believe this should work:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE Store as ST (Price, Amount) = (SELECT OD.Price, ST.Amount + OD.Amount
                                      FROM OrderHeader as OH
                                      JOIN OrderDetails as OD
                                      ON OH.Number = OD.Number
                                      JOIN Articles as A
                                      ON A.Reference = OD.Article
                                      WHERE OH.Store = ST.Store
                                      AND OH.Date = '2009-12-04'
                                      AND OH.Number = 26485)
WHERE ST.Store = '074'
      AND EXISTS (SELECT '1'
                  FROM OrderHeader as OH
                  JOIN OrderDetails as OD
                  ON OH.Number = OD.Number
                  JOIN Articles as A
                  ON A.Reference = OD.Article
                  WHERE OH.Store = ST.Store
                  AND OH.Date = '2009-12-04'
                  AND OH.Number = 26485)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>WHERE EXISTS</code> is to prevent against <code>NULL</code> results.  I'm assuming <code>Store</code> has an <code>id</code> column to match.<br>
This will only work if the tables will return one (and only one) row for the given selection criteria.  If this is not the case, you will need to supply more details.</p>
