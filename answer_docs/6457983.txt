<p>I've only worked with Pervasive once or twice, but I can't imagine that the engine is that horrible that the problem would be a simple <code>LIKE</code> as you have it. The issue is more likely the subquery.</p>

<p>I would try this instead:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE
    I2
SET
    BVRTLPRICE01 = I1.BVRTLPRICE01
FROM
    INVENTORY I2
INNER JOIN INVENTORY I1 ON
    I1.CODE = REPLACE(LEFT(I2.CODE, 1), 'S', 'C') +
              SUBSTRING(I2.CODE, 2, LENGTH(I2.CODE)))
WHERE
    I2.CODE LIKE 'S%'
</code></pre>

<p>Also, make sure that you're only joining on one row from I1 and not getting many rows for each row in I2.</p>
