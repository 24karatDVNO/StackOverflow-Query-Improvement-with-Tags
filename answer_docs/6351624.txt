<p>I think if you hook in a "destroy" post to the undo button it will at least remove the links if they click undo. Basically you pass a hash with the special <code>_destroy</code> key it will remove the nested model records. </p>

<p>From Rails 3 docs <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>:</p>

<pre><code>class Member &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
   has_one :avatar
   accepts_nested_attributes_for :avatar, :allow_destroy =&gt; true
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now, when you add the _destroy key to the attributes hash, with a value that evaluates to true, you will destroy the associated model:</p>

<pre><code>member.avatar_attributes = { :id =&gt; '2', :_destroy =&gt; '1' }
member.avatar.marked_for_destruction? # =&gt; true
member.save
member.reload.avatar # =&gt; nil
</code></pre>
