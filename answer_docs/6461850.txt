<p>You don't appear to be doing anything with your SqlDataReader.  Typically you would have something like this:</p>

<pre><code>using (SqlDataReader sdr = cmd.ExecuteReader())
{
   while(sdr.Read())
   {
      //whatever
   }
...
</code></pre>

<p>Right now it looks like you are executing the command and then doing nothing with the results.  I'm not sure how the DataTable comes into play either.</p>
