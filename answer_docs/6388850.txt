<p>I'm not sure how you're using that method (in a loop, or what), but, if you can, set up another NSAutoreleasepool to release those objects as soon as you can.</p>

<p>Here's an example of how you could use it with a loop to get rid of autoreleased objects ASAP.</p>

<pre><code>for (NSInteger i = 0; i &lt; 99999999999999; i++ )
{
    NSAutoreleasePool *innerPool = [[NSAutoreleasePool alloc] init];
    NSString *string = [NSString string];
    // code
    [innerPool release];
}
</code></pre>
