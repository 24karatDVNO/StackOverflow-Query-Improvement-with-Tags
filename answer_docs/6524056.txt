<p>Personally I don't like when the undo stack is cleared after a save. When programming I hit Ctrl-S very often (everybody knows the importance of saving:-)) and at the same time I want to be able to undo some of the recent changes. </p>

<p>In my opinion it is an unpleasant surprise not to be able to undo after a save. And by applying a rule of the least surpirse (to the user) you should keep the undo history.</p>
