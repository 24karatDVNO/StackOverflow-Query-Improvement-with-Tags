<p>You could use <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Mail%3a%3aPOP3Client" rel="nofollow">Mail::POP3Client</a> to poll the mailbox for messages. Or if the mailbox supports IMAP and you want to continuously monitor it, use an IMAP module, perhaps <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Net%3a%3aIMAP%3a%3aSimple" rel="nofollow">Net::IMAP::Simple</a> ?</p>

<p>I just googled for [Asterisk Perl] and <a href="http://osnow.org/images/4/41/How_to_Write_a_Perl_AGI_Application.pdf" rel="nofollow">a guide called "How to Write a Perl AGI Application"</a> appeared on the first page. It describes how to use the <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Asterisk%3a%3aAGI" rel="nofollow">Asterisk::AGI</a> module to connect to an Asterisk server using Perl.</p>

<p>Finally, you'll need a text-to-speech application. I'm sure there are many of these available. They probably won't be written in Perl, but there may be existing Perl interfaces for them.</p>
