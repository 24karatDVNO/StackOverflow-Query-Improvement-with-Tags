<p>It depends how are you going to use your code. If the properties are simple types like integers &amp; strings, default values are better, if the properties are objects by themselves, I used nulls, because in C# / Java / PHP, objects references are really object pointers and better to use.</p>

<p>But, if your properties are collections, like lists or maps , its a "better practice" , to create the collection, and leave it empty, instead of null.</p>
