<p>I just cut-and-pasted your example into a file; it ran fine under bash.  I don't see any problems with it.</p>

<p>For good measure you may want to ensure it ends with a newline, though bash shouldn't care.  (It runs for me both with and without the final newline.)</p>

<p>You'll sometimes see strange errors if you've accidentally embedded a control character in the file.  Since it's a short script, try creating a new script by pasting it from your question here on StackOverflow, or by simply re-typing it.</p>

<p>What version of bash are you using?  (<code>bash --version</code>)</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
