<p>I'm not aware of any software that does this directly (though it might exist) but stuff similar to what you want to do has been done. A few pointers:</p>

<ul>
<li>Google for <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?hl=nl&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=mUN&amp;channel=cs&amp;q=vision%20based%20robot%20localization&amp;oq=vision%20based%20robot%20localization&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=undefined&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=42984l46160l0l15l12l0l0l0l2l200l1286l6.5.1l12" rel="nofollow">"Vision based robot localization"</a> the problem you state is very similar to the problem robots with a camera have when they enter a new environment. In this field the approach is usually to have the robot map its environment and then use the model for later reference, but the techniques are similar to what you'll need.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_flow" rel="nofollow">Optical flow</a> will roughly tell you in what direction the camera is moving, but it won't tell you the speed because you have no objective reference. This is because you don't know if the things you see moving in the video feed are 1cm away and very small or 1 mile away and very big. </li>
<li>If you know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_matrix" rel="nofollow">camera matrix</a> of the camera recording the images you could try <a href="http://www.google.nl/search?hl=nl&amp;client=ubuntu&amp;hs=L02&amp;channel=cs&amp;q=partial%203D%20scene%20reconstruction&amp;oq=partial%203D%20scene%20reconstruction&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=undefined&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=18592l18882l0l2l2l0l0l0l0l116l193l1.1l2" rel="nofollow">partial 3D scene reconstruction</a> techniques to take a stab at the speed. Note that you can do the 3D scene stuff without the camera matrix (this is the "uncalibrated" part you see in the title of a lot of the google results), the camera matrix will let you add real world object sizes (and hence distances) to your reconstruction.</li>
<li>The amount of images/second you need depends on the speed of the camera. More is better, but my guess is that 5/second should be sufficient at walking speeds.</li>
<li>Using extra sensors will help. Probably the robot localization articles talk about this as well.</li>
