<p>It'll be tedious, but I'd suggest creating N steps (where N = the number of parallel tasks you want)</p>

<p>Each step will generally do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Check if the current reviewer field is empty (if so, skip to the next step)</li>
<li>Create a new "Task" item in a (task) List</li>
<li>Send an email to the person you assigned the task to</li>
</ol>

<p>Then you'll need to somehow stop your workflow until all of the tasks have been completed. This part gets a bit trickier, but do some searches on creating a State Machine workflow in SharePoint Designer and you'll be on the right track.</p>

<p>Really though, this sounds like a workflow that's too complex for SPD. Use Visual Studio or some 3rd-party workflow solution if at all possible.</p>
