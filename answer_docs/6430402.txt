<p>The array will be O(1) to find the item and O(n) to move it and the other items into the correct position. The linked list will be O(n) to find the item and O(1) to move everything to the right position. The complexity is the same either way.</p>

<p>They're both easy to implement, so implement both of them and run tests to see which one lets your program run faster with real-world data.</p>
