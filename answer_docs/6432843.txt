<p>Seems like it was an issue with the lib.  I switched to using this YAML dumper:  <a href="https://github.com/ingydotnet/yaml-oscon2009-talk/blob/e54dd6a1650c3e80e784f3ada8f59c1b7157fb94/Sample/YAML.js" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/ingydotnet/yaml-oscon2009-talk/blob/e54dd6a1650c3e80e784f3ada8f59c1b7157fb94/Sample/YAML.js</a> like so:  <code>console.log(YAML.dump(obj))</code> and got the results I was looking for.</p>
