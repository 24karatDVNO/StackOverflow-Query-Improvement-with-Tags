<p>Sounds like visual studio is trying to do something on port 80, which IIS is blocking ( thats the default listener port for it ).</p>

<p>A simple google search of <a href="http://www.google.co.za/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=port%2080%20visual%20studio" rel="nofollow">port 80 visual studio</a> brings up several promising hits ( how to configure it, and hey! 2nd one even has a fix for a similar problem. )</p>
