<p>Your query doesn't have the rownum listed in the first nested table. Add a rownum column in the first nested table then you can do a between function in the where clause at the top level:</p>

<pre><code>--create a demo table
DROP TABLE paging_test;
CREATE TABLE paging_test AS
  (SELECT rownum x FROM user_tables
  );

--count how many records exist (in my case there is 821)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM paging_test;

--get the first 300 rows
SELECT *
FROM
  (SELECT rownum rn, x FROM paging_test ORDER BY x
  ) pt
WHERE pt.rn BETWEEN 1 AND 300 ;

--get the next 300 rows
SELECT *
FROM
  (SELECT rownum rn, x FROM paging_test ORDER BY x
  ) pt
WHERE pt.rn BETWEEN 300 AND 600 ;
</code></pre>
