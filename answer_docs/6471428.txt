<p>Assuming the IDs must match up in order to make the comparisons legitimate:</p>

<pre><code>select n.*
from new n
left join old o on o.id = n.id
where o.id is null
  or not (
    and o.name = n.name
    and o.number = n.number
    and o.email = n.email
    and ...)
</code></pre>

<p>Note, this solution handles the case where some of the fields can be NULL.  If you use (o.name &lt;> n.name) instead of not (o.name = n.name) you won't correctly consider NULLs to be different from non-nulls.</p>
