<p>You could also use a macro to simply insert the text "+2005" after the number. This will be evaluated by the DB (although it does depend on exactly what SQL you are generating). In the case of the SQL in the Excel answer comment you'd likely need to change to an <code>INSERT INTO ... SELECT ..., 3456+2005, ...</code> to get the evaluation to work.</p>
