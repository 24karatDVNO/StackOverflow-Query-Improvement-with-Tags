<p>I've steered clear of the Microsoft ORMs and I'm rather glad that I have.  There's a constant cycle of hype -> acceptance -> realization of weaknesses &amp; flaws -> end-of-life, begin again.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of .Net, just not Microsoft ORMs.  There are better solutions out there.</p>

<p>I realize this is just opinion but I offer it for what it's worth.</p>
