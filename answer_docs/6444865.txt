<p>The problem was actually completely unrelated to the excel export. The “…could not be parsed” error was the key. From these links I got the key, which was that the grid events cause only a partial postback event: </p>

<p>This explains the ThreadAbortException and the “…could not be parsed” error. Adding this to the OnPreRender of the ImageButton was the solution:</p>

<pre><code>protected void addTrigger_PreRender(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    if (sender is ImageButton)
    {
        ImageButton imgBtn = (ImageButton)sender;
        ScriptManager ScriptMgr = (ScriptManager)this.FindControl("ScriptManager1");
        ScriptMgr.RegisterPostBackControl(ImgBtn);
    }
}
</code></pre>
