<p>This might work and avoid a O(n) type solution:</p>

<pre><code>public int DaysLeft(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate, Boolean excludeWeekends, String excludeDates)
{

    //Work out days in range
    int days = (int)endDate.Subtract(startDate).TotalDays + 1;

    if (excludeWeekends)
    {
        //Remove most weekends by removing 2 in 7 days (rounded down)
        days -= ((int)Math.Floor((decimal)(days / 7)) * 2);

        if (startDate.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Sunday) days -= 1;
        if (startDate.DayOfWeek == DayOfWeek.Saturday) days -= 2;
    }                  

    return days;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Its not exhaustively tested though.</p>

<p>To handle the exclusions dates you could loop through those and exclude where they're between start and end (and not a weekend if appropriate). This should be a shorter loop than going through all the days between start and end.</p>
