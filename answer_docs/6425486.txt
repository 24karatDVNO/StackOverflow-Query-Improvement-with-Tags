<p>This problem also happens to me and like you said completely random. I have found that cleaning the solution then deleting the "Bin" and "obj" folders and rebuilding the solution corrects the issue. Sometimes I have to delete and rebuild a couple times for it to work, very stange I know. If you do not see the "Bin" and "obj" folders, click the "Show All Files" icon at the top of the Solution Explorer. Hopefully there is a better solution to this issue than what I have suggested but it does work for me and I hope it does for you as well. Please mark as answered if this resolves your issue.</p>
