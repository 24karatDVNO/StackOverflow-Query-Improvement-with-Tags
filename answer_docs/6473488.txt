<p>I do this on Ruby 1.9 when I want to make sure things are in UTF-8:</p>

<pre><code>if filename.encoding.to_s != 'UTF-8'
  filename.encode!('UTF-8')
end
</code></pre>

<p>Unless your OS gives a file name encoded with a coding system which doesn't support some special characters found on the file name, it can be encoded to UTF-8 without a hickup.</p>
