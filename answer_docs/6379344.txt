<p>I think if you update your request's datatype from jsonp to json then the data object in the response handler should already be parsed, so</p>

<pre><code>alert(data.name);
</code></pre>

<p>should work (if the returned object conforms to your example above)</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: this answer based on the OP's indication that the response was json, but response appears to be jsonp</p>
