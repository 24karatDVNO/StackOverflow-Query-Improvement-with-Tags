<p>If you don't want to do it in code by hand (though that certainly seems like the easiest answer for such a simple task) you could instead use an XSLT tranformation. Using a stylesheet might also make the process a little more flexible since you would just need to update the stylesheet instead of the code when/if the source formats change. My understanding based on another question (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4508803/xslt-support-in-android-2-1-and-older">XSLT support in Android 2.1 (and older)?</a>) is that Android 2.2 contains an XSLT transformer. You might also be able to use Saxon (<a href="http://saxon.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://saxon.sourceforge.net</a>).</p>

<p>Since you're going from one XML file to many you would need to use the result-document directive from XSLT 2.0. Here's how: <a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipmultxsl/index.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/xml/library/x-tipmultxsl/index.html</a>.</p>
