<p>Are you sure this code shows something for other phones? As Neeraj answered, you have to add .show() to the Toast.</p>

<p>If that is not an issue &amp; you just missed it here, then you might have come across a problem I was facing too. A piece of code similar to yours worked perfectly on <strong>Motorola Atrix</strong>, but not on <strong>Motorola Droid</strong>. </p>

<p><strong>Here was my workaround. In case GPS is not available, I fall back on the Network provider</strong>. Like so:</p>

<pre><code>//Start with fine location using GPS
String locationProviderInit = LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER;
if ((locationProviderInit == null) ||   
      !(mLocationManager.isProviderEnabled(locationProviderInit)))
{
//If GPS not available, fall back on coarse location
    locationProviderInit = LocationManager.NETWORK_PROVIDER;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
