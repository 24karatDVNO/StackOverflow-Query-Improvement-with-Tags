<p>At the risk of saying it you don't really have any options: you should do the user-agent check for the Blackberry browser because for the more casual user who is not used to playing with browser user agents that will work, but for anyone who is dedicated they'll be able to get around it.</p>

<p>What is probably most useful is to automatically expire the links after a certain time: generate a link to not only the JAD file but to the COD files as well and then make those links expire after a day or two. Will at least reduce the chance that the links get redistributed or that they know specifically where the COD files are. Not sure how that will work with the Blackberry installer though.</p>
