<p>I'm no regex wizard, but You'd need something similar to:                           </p>

<pre><code>^(On ).{3}, (19|20)\d\d-\d\d-\d\d at \d\d:\d\d -\d\d\d\d,
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously its not as clean in validating valid times and dates but I'm assuming your email server isn't spitting out invalids.</p>
