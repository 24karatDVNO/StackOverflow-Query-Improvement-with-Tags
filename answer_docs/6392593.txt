<p>I can't say for sure that this is your problem but you may want to try using the <code>make</code> that is available with <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys" rel="nofollow">MSYS</a>. I've always had better success with it. From <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/FAQ#faq-mingw32-make.exe" rel="nofollow">MinGW's own FAQ</a>..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The "native" (i.e.: MSVCRT dependent)
  port of make is lacking in some
  functionality and has modified
  functionality due to the lack of POSIX
  on Win32.</p>
