<p>My guess would be that you are living in the UK. </p>

<p>PHP is configured to use the local timezone of your country. This results in a time of 1:00: GMT + 1 hour for the Daylight Savings.</p>

<p>There are 2 possible solutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Substract one hour from the timestamp you're using</li>
<li>Configure your script to use GMT. Use the function @pekka mentioned to do this.</li>
</ul>

<p>I suggest the first solution; your script might need to pretty print individual times, along with the intervals, which you want to have converted to your local timezone.</p>
