<p>You can generate a unique ID when the user first logins in during the registration process. You can use the <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.uniqid.php" rel="nofollow">uniqid</a> function to generate a unique id for that user. Then store the unique id in a database along with the users credentials.</p>
