<p>From what I can tell, certreq.exe ships with the server editions of Windows. I am assuming you're using the desktop variants.</p>

<p>As an alternative, I suggest the use of <code>openssl</code> to generate certificates. Check out <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/req.html" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
