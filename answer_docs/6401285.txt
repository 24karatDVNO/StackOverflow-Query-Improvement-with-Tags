<p>When rotating, the algorithm (essentially) averages each pixel with the "next" pixel value. For all pixels "inside" the image, the next pixel is defined. For all pixels at the edge of the image, that pixel is undefined. </p>

<p>So the grey is the average between the known perimeter pixel and an undefined exterior pixel.</p>
