<p>It is not going to make a difference. The time it takes to garbage collect (newly allocated objects) is proportional to the number of objects that should <strong>not</strong> be garbage collected. To put it in another way: removing references between objects that should be garbage collected will not speed up garbage collection, it will just waste a little time setting variables to null...</p>
