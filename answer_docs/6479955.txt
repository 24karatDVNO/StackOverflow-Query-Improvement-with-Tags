<p>From what I can tell from your question and code, you seem to be missing at least 1 javascript function which is required to compare the generated CAPTCHA against the one entered by the user.
Another function you are missing (unless my JavaScript is that bad) is a function to actually generate the CAPTCHA.</p>

<p>Without these two <strong>vital</strong> functions the whole script will not work. Finally, is there a particular reason that you are using so many different <code>$_SESSION</code> variables? Having a bit more formatting in your code would prove to be helpful in the future so that you can read your code better and help us to read it too...
Although it goes against my better judgement this might help you a bit: <a href="http://www.irishwebmasterforum.com/coding-help/417-javascript-captcha-for-use-on-forms.html" rel="nofollow">javascript based captcha's</a></p>
