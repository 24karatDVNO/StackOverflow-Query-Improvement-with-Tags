<pre><code> [parentView setUserInteractionEnabled:NO];
</code></pre>

<p>The snippet above disables user interaction for the <code>parentView</code> and all its subviews. So even if you follow it up with,</p>

<pre><code> [childView setUserInteractionEnabled:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>it won't work. You might want to rethink disabling user interaction on the parent view or do not add the <code>childView</code> as its subview.</p>
