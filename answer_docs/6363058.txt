<p>You can ignore by extension (e.g. *.dll or *.pdb) or all files (just *) if that's what you are trying to do? See here for a way to manually edit the properties : <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/tsvn-dug-propertypage.html" rel="nofollow">Project Settings</a>.</p>

<p>If that is not the case, I would look at re-organising the way that the files are stored / generated so that there are not a combination of versioned and unversioned in the same directory where so many require ignoring. For example, move them all to a sub folder and ignore that.</p>
