<p>Here is my RegexContains function. Pass it the cell and the pattern and it will return TRUE or FALSE if it contains it or not.</p>

<pre><code>Function RegexContains(ByVal find_in As String, _
                       ByVal find_what As String, _
                       Optional IgnoreCase As Boolean = False) As Boolean

Application.ScreenUpdating = False

Dim RE As Object
Set RE = CreateObject("vbscript.regexp")

RE.Pattern = find_what
RE.IgnoreCase = IgnoreCase
RE.Global = True
RegexContains = RE.Test(find_in)

Application.ScreenUpdating = True

End Function
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'm not sure exactly what you want to find in your example, but if you want to know if the cell contains a single letter followed by one or more letters, then you would use (assuming the cell is A1):   =RegexContains(A1, "^\w\d+")</p>

<ul>
<li>The ^ marks the start of the sentence</li>
<li>The \w marks a single alphabetic
character (a-zA-Z)</li>
<li>The \d+ marks one or more numeric
characters[0-9]</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope this helps.</p>
