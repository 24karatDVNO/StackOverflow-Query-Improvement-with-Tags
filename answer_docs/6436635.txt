<p>I dont think the inline creation of <code>new List&lt;ParentDetail&gt;();</code> is needed as it is already done inside your constructor..Or else you can remove the constructor as a whole...</p>

<p>The inline code when compiled creates a default constructor and moves that piece of code inside the constructor.</p>
