<p>"Grant Permission on Item" is not a standard out-of-the-box SPD workflow action for SharePoint 2007 (WSS or MOSS).</p>

<p>djeeg's reply was assuming that you were working in Visual Studio on a custom workflow action, not in SharePoint designer.</p>

<p>Ultimately, you'll either need to build your own custom action for this, or use one like <a href="http://spdactivities.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http://spdactivities.codeplex.com/</a> . In either case, you're not being nearly specific enough here.</p>
