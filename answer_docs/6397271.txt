<p>The main question you should ask yourself is- could I just make this a virtual function on Entity? In this case, I would probably say "no", because it doesn't make sense for non-Items to know or care about what you're gonna do with an Item. So <code>dynamic_cast</code> probably is the right solution- you can safely handle the case of <code>null</code> coming back and it keeps the other derived classes from having to know anything about Item.</p>
