<p><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html" rel="nofollow">The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)</a> - by Joel Spolsky</p>

<p>and</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_%28Unicode_block%29" rel="nofollow">the Wikipedia page for the unicode block for Arabic</a></p>
