<p>The first thing to jump out at me is </p>

<pre><code> SELECT distinct Enrollment.StudentNo, enrollment.CourseNo, prereqNeeded.prereq 
from Enrollment, (SELECT ENROLLMENT.CourseNo, PrereqCourseNo, StudentNo
            from enrollment, prerequisite 
                where ENROLLMENT.CourseNo = PREREQUISITE.CourseNo AND 
                NOT EXISTS 
                (SELECT StudentNo, MARK 
                FROM ENROLLMENT 
                WHERE enrollment.CourseNo = PrereqCourseNo 
                AND MARK &gt;= 50)) prereqNeeded 
WHERE Enrollment.StudentNo = prereqNeeded.StudentNo 
and prereqNeeded.CourseNo = ENROLLMENT.CourseNo
</code></pre>

<p>I think you need to keep the case of the table names. </p>

<pre><code> SELECT distinct Enrollment.StudentNo, Enrollment.CourseNo, prereqNeeded.prereq 
from Enrollment, (SELECT Enrollment.CourseNo, PrereqCourseNo, StudentNo
            from Enrollment, Prerequisite 
                where Enrollment.CourseNo = Prerequisite.CourseNo AND 
                NOT EXISTS 
                (SELECT StudentNo, MARK 
                FROM Enrollment 
                WHERE Enrollment.CourseNo = PrereqCourseNo 
                AND MARK &gt;= 50)) prereqNeeded 
WHERE Enrollment.StudentNo = prereqNeeded.StudentNo 
and prereqNeeded.CourseNo = Enrollment.CourseNo 
</code></pre>

<p>Could be wrong but on the DB I use it complains about this.</p>
