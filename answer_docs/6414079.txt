<p>If you are trying to read the value of 'A' within PHP, you have to use bind variables.  You also need to pass the bind variable in as a reference.  And since you cannot rename your A variable you can do something like this ... </p>

<pre><code>$rVal = '';
$sql = "declare
        A varchar2(16);
        docs.InsT(...);
        :rVal := A;
        end;";
$stid = oci_parse($conn, trim($sql));
oci_bind_by_name($stid, ':rVal', &amp;$rVal, 16);
oci_execute($stid);
oci_commit($conn);
var_dump($rVal);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>$rVal</strong> now contains the value of <strong>A</strong> from oracle.</p>
