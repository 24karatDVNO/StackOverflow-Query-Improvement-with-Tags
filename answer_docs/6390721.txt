<p>NULL comparisons are always false. And empty string or single space is a value which is not NULL.</p>

<p>However, GROUP BY will recognise it and count it.</p>

<p>Try these</p>

<pre><code>select count(*) from id_rec
where correct_addr &lt;&gt; 'N' or correct_addr IS NULL

select count(*) from id_rec
where COALESCE(correct_addr, 'X') &lt;&gt; 'N' 


select count(*) from id_rec
where COALESCE(correct_addr, ' ') in (' ','Y');
</code></pre>

<p>Also, COUNT(column) will ignore NULLS so some more to try</p>

<pre><code>select count(correct_addr), COUNT(*) from id_rec GROUP BY correct_addr

select count(correct_addr), COUNT(*) from id_rec
where correct_addr &lt;&gt; 'N' or correct_addr IS NULL
</code></pre>

<p>Note: char(1) will always pad to a space</p>
