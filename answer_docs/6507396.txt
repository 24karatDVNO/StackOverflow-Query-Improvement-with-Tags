<p>I think you're looking for SMARTY template tags and custom variables defined for Prestashop specifically. The one the you probably need is <code>{$base_dir}</code> which will be translated to <code>http://www.yoursite.com/</code> obviously with appropriate protocol (non-secure HTTP or secured HTTPS).</p>

<p>After that, you only need to include page URL, which you can get from Admin->Tools->CMS section.</p>

<p>If I find any specific tags that you can use to call the content, I will update my post here.</p>
