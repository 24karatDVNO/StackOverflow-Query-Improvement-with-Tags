<p>Subversion and Subclipse is the ideal team solution for you. What you're asking for (some type of linked real-time editor) doesn't really exist anywhere (and probably wouldn't be terribly useful, otherwise we'd already be doing it).</p>

<p>So I think the answer to your question is, you just need to coordinate, plan, and communicate and divide up work so that you aren't stepping on each other's code changes. A decent architecture that doesn't cause your code updates to clash all the time is key. (Try dividing the project up into "modules" or sub-components, or even better (if this is applicable), just have one person focus on server-side dev (Java, Coldfusion, or whatever) and have the other worry about the Flex UI. This is one of the easier methods of keeping your client and server code somewhat decoupled, of course you still need to communicate and plan regarding the service interface.</p>
