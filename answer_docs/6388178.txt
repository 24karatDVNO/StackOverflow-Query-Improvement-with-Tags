<p>I can't speak to the specifics of your image recognition library, but I can tell you that nearly all of the actual APIs for Android are in Java and all of Cocoa touch is in ObjC. This may not be an issue just for your library, but as soon as you need to hook into any of the existing APIs you will want to be writing Java or ObjC.</p>
