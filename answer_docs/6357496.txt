<p>I was using single line comments on my eclipse php project. When i uploaded it to server ,some obfuscation has been applied automatically.Hence all the line breaks are removed and it treating the whole program as a single line. so i am getting an END OF STATEMENT error on server.So its better to use /<em>--</em>/ instead of //---- while commenting.</p>
