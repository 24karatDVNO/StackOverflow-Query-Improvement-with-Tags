<p>additional stuff to the first answer:
&lt;&lt; Processing has native Android support in the latest version (1.5.1). You just need to change the IDE view into "Android" from "Standard".</p>

<p>when you click Run button it automatically uses Android.  However you have to download the emulator thing from the website (SDK <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>) and you have to tell the Processing where the application is so that it sends your sketch to Android.</p>
