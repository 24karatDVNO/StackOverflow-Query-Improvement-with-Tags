<p>Take a look here: <a href="http://jonraasch.com/blog/css-rounded-corners-in-all-browsers" rel="nofollow">http://jonraasch.com/blog/css-rounded-corners-in-all-browsers</a> and here: <a href="http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/rounded_corners_experiment_ie/" rel="nofollow">http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/rounded_corners_experiment_ie/</a></p>

<p>If you have IE6 running now, definitely try the demo from the second link (here: <a href="http://snook.ca/technical/rounded_corners/" rel="nofollow">http://snook.ca/technical/rounded_corners/</a>).</p>

<p>I don't have IE6, so I can't tell you if it works.</p>
