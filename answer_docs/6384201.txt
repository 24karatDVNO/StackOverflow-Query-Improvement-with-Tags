<p>Google has about 1000 servers in one country. When you press enter, the query is sent to as many of the servers as possible and then they all search a certain amount of their search database, and then they put their results together and send them to your computer. </p>

<p>More information is available in a book called <em>The Google Story</em>. I don't have it with me at the moment, so I can't find out the author. </p>
