<p>I've seen that error when you're trying to add a file in the repository and not in a working directory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Did you do a checkout of the working directory <strong><em>outside</em></strong> of the repository itself?</li>
<li>Were you able to run the <code>svn add</code> command successfully?</li>
<li>What does the <code>svn status</code> command show you?</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, are you using the command line or some GUI client to do this task?</p>
