<p>you might just need to reinstall the mysql2 gem.</p>

<p>first you should find your mysql_config.
you can do this by issuing:</p>

<pre><code>sudo find /usr/local -name mysql_config
</code></pre>

<p>then install the gem with </p>

<pre><code>(sudo) gem install mysql2 -- --with-mysql-config=RESULT_FROM_ABOVE
</code></pre>

<p>this should give you a gem that is configured with your mysql installation.
Hope that helps.</p>
