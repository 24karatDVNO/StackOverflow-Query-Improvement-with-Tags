<p>This is probably less of a Cake-specific issue and more of a PHP / MySQL issue. (Others have already brought up encoding, so I'll skip that.)</p>

<p>Single quotes means a literal string being handed to MySQL: <code>'Item.name != ' =&gt; ''</code></p>

<p>PHP (a la Cake) probably parses that string quite literally. In fact, it's might even be parsing it like:</p>

<pre><code>"Item.name != "
</code></pre>

<p>(note there's nothing after the operand? and if it falls last in the SQL query, the query wouldn't error, it would probably still work!)</p>

<p>When you meant for it to test:</p>

<pre><code>"Item.name != ''"
</code></pre>

<p>(note empty single quotes now included in the string)</p>

<p>However, since you're not getting an error - and the rest of the data pulls! - you probably want to edit that statement, because your problem is more likely syntax.</p>

<pre><code>'Item.name IS NOT NULL'
'Item.name &lt;&gt; ' =&gt; ''
'Item.name IS NOT' =&gt; ''
</code></pre>

<p>Give those a try. </p>
