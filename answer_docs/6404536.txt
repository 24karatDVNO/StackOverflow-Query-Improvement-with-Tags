<p>Have you ever written anything to the DB? do you know that the DB definitely has data in it? If not try installing a SQLLite browser such as <a href="http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://sqlitebrowser.sourceforge.net/</a> and have a look at the tables.</p>

<p>That should help you identify if the problem is with writing to the table or reading from it. Might be able to help further if you provide your DBAdapter class</p>
