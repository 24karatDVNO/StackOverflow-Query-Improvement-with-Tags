<p>I will not give you an answer, but I will tell you what has to be done.</p>

<p>Lets take</p>

<pre><code>1
12
123
1234
12345
</code></pre>

<p>From 1 to a particular number (from the user or whatever) (lets call this max)
    you print all the numbers from 1 to the current index</p>

<pre><code>54321
4321
321
21
1
</code></pre>

<p>Same as the one above, but you loop backwards</p>

<pre><code>     1
    21
   321
  4321
 54321
</code></pre>

<p>From 1 to max
   print n+1 spaces where n is the difference between the max and the current index</p>
