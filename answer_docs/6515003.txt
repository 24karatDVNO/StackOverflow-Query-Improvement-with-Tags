<p>I behaves that way because it's not a select-box, it's a combo-box.</p>

<p>If you had the following items:</p>

<ul>
<li>a</li>
<li>aa</li>
<li>aaa</li>
</ul>

<p>and you selected "aa", there would then be two options in the box: 'aa', and 'aaa'.</p>

<p>If you think carefully about how you'd like it to work, you'll realize that to get what you want will break ability to have any sort of meaningful type-ahead functionality.</p>
