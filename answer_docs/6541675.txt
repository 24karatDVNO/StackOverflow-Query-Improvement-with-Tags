<p>Wes has offered two good answers. Another solution is to create a second branch. Go to your source repository and checkout the second branch. You can now push to the master branch from you work repository.</p>

<pre><code>cd master_repo
git checkout -b stepaside
cd work_repo
git push
</code></pre>

<p>Subsequent pushes you can replace with</p>

<pre><code>cd master_repo
git checkout stepaside
cd work_repo
git push
</code></pre>
