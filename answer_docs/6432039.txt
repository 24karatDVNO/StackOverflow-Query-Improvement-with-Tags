<p>Make a system call to the php file and detach it?</p>

<p>ex:</p>

<pre><code>exec('nohup php test.php &gt; test.out 2&gt; test.err &lt; /dev/null &amp;');

echo 'I am totally printing here';
</code></pre>

<p>test.php contains a sleep for 2 seconds and prints, but echo returns immediately.</p>

<p>Have it store the results in a file/database/whatever. It will act like a very dirty fork.</p>

<p>You could also do something similar with a CURL call I bet if you have issues executing.</p>
