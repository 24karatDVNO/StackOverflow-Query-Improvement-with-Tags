<p>See the documentation <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/z714w2y9.aspx" rel="nofollow">here</a>. It says "AntiAlias and HighQuality are equivalent and specify rendering with smoothing applied." I'm assuming that the enum is coded such that enum SmoothingMode { AntiAliased = 2, HighQuality = 2 }. When the cast is performed, the first item declared in the enum with value 2 will be selected. In this case AntiAliased appears first so it is selected. This would not be a problem if instead you set the SmoothingMode property from an enum value instead.</p>
