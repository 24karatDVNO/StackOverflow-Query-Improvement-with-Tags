<p>You need to unzip the zip before trying to open it. It looks like you're just double-clicking the zip in Windows Explorer, then trying to open the solution file directly from the zip archive. That is, the path:</p>

<pre><code>C:\Users\Eric\AppData\Local\Temp\Temp3_WcfServiceConsole_**.zip**\WcfServiceConsole\WcfServiceConsole\WcfServiceConsole.csproj
</code></pre>

<p>appears to be a path within a zip file. Visual Studio can't work with this until you unzip it.</p>
