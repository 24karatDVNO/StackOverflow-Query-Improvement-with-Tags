<p>I have look how to do it trough HTTP with the Apache HttpClient4 and HttpCore4 libraries and I have wrote this code, you think it would work properly? Thank you very much!</p>

<pre><code>private String server;
//private Integer port;

// getter and settler methods for server property

public void sendXML(String fileName) throws Exception{
    try{
        File file = new File(fileName);
        FileEntity entity = new FileEntity(file, "text/xml; charset=\"UTF-8\"");
        DefaultHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
        HttpPost method = new HttpPost(server);
        method.setEntity(entity);
        HttpResponse response = httpclient.execute(method);
    }
    catch(IOException e){
        e.printStackTrace();
    }
}
</code></pre>
