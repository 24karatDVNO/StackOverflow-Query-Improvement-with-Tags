<p>Beyond changing the browser-specific CSS, I don't think there's anything you'd have to change. I don't know the specifics of your webapp, but unless you want non-standards support (IE6/7 for your XML, in which case you'll need to add activeX object XMLHttpRequest support), the javascript and html should not need changing between browsers.</p>

<p>To access the app from other browsers, you'll need to deploy it if you haven't already, then find the root folder and copy that. If you don't have another editing application already, I'd suggest <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/" rel="nofollow" title="TextWrangler Product Page">TextWrangler</a> as a free app, or <a href="http://macromates.com/" rel="nofollow" title="TextMate Product Page">TextMate</a> as a (rather pricey) paid alternative.</p>

<p>N.B.: I've not actually ported anything from Dashcode per se, but this is based off of about 3 minutes of testing things in it and some experience porting websites.</p>
