<p>If you have only <strong>one</strong> instance of a class that shares between multiple threads, it's ok to use normal object. but if you have multiple objects of a class that share between multiple threads, you have to use <strong>static</strong> object.</p>

<p>On the other hand, with normal object you can manage concurrency for <strong>one</strong> instance of a class and with static object you can manage concurrency in the scope of <strong>all</strong> instances of a class.</p>
