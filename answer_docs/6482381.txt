<p>Here is a pure CSS solution...</p>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/wdm954/tAaCF/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/wdm954/tAaCF/1/</a></p>

<p>Basically using CSS3 <code>border-radius</code> and <code>box-shadow</code> to replace the need for an image. This is going to be a bit less stylish in older browsers. For simple styling like this it shouldn't be a deal breaker if those who are already suffering through a lack of CSS3 across the Web don't get to see some pretty rounded corners. The older browsers will still show a blue background on hover.</p>
