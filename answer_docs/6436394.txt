<p>removing Three20 framework is really difficult. Did you make sure that you have removed all the entries from your pbxproj file? When you add three20, it adds hunderds of lines in pbxproj and there is no simple way of removing them all. As per my knowledge you can only remove them mannually by opening pbxproj in text editor. The errors you are getting could be due that.. </p>
