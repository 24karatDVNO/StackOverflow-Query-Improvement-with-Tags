<p>I found a MultiBinding sample project for Silverlight on the net, there are a number of them I believe, just Google it. If you can't find one let me know I'll send you the one we're using.
Does anyone know if multi-binding is coming to SL 5? You can use a 3rd property as well, just remember to fire it's <code>PropertyChanged</code> event when ever either of it's constituents changes then binding will be fine.</p>
