<p>You should rather use the <a href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qcheckbox.html#stateChanged" rel="nofollow">stateChanged()</a> signal, emitted by the checkbox when its status changes. It gives you an integer, because checkboxes can also be tristate (but you can just use that int value as a boolean, in your case).</p>
