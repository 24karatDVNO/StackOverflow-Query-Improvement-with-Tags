<p>It looks OK for me.  Although the releases inside the getString:fromXPath: aren't necessary (you don't need to release parameters entered into a method or objects obtained from a NSArray.  The proper way to release an object from a NSArray is removing it from the array, as for objects passed as a parameter, if you want to release it you should do it after you call the method.</p>
