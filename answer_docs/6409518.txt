<p>you should put all the vendor prefixes first, then the CSS3 equivalent.
In your case it would looke like this:</p>

<pre><code>-webkit-border-radius:10px;
-moz-border-radius:10px;
border-radius:10px;
</code></pre>

<p>Internet Explorer 6,7,8 won't round corners, but this is ok from a progressive enhancement point of view. If it isn't ok from the client's point of view, you can either include a CSS based on CSS conditional statements and use a sprite with rounded corners or use a JavaScript fallback like <a href="http://css3pie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://css3pie.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Older versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari or Opera will round corners because of the vendor prefix.</p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
