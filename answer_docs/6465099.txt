<p>A lot of people like svn for it's similarities with a real filesystem, and using trunks as branches, etc, and others prefer git for it's powerful functionality.  I personally prefer git, but the learning-curve can be a little daunting, and I routinely force VCS' into submission as part of my job.
converting from svn to git (or any other VCS) is going to be difficult, and you're likely to be forced to make compromises that you hadn't anticipated.
As an alternative, you might like Mercurial.  I'm not really a fan, but it has most/all of git's power with a much friendlier interface. It is easily as popular as the other two, and is probably going to be the least painful to convert to git, later, due to the common heritage.</p>
