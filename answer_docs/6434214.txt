<p>When you call context.notify(), you can pass in an object that contains both the payload you want to send out and the list of IPs that should get it.  Then in your CometHandler, you can simply check the requests remote/client IP against that list.  If the list is empty or contains the IP for that handler, send it.  Otherwise, ignore it.  When you create your handler you'll want to pass in or attach the necessary info to do that check but that's a pretty simple affair, too.</p>
