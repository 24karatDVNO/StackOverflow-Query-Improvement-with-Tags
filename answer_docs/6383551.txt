<p>Ok, so I have <em>mostly</em> figured out the problem.  It stems from the fact that I am not using a proper skin technique on my custom component.  The custom component logic is fine where it is at, but I need to prepare a separate skin class that actually instantiates the custom component's "parts" (ie: sub-components).  Currently, the custom component does this in createChildren().  Furthermore, to take advantage of the colorization mechanic, the skin class must inherit from SparkSkin.  The TitleWindowCloseButton instance needs to be a member of the custom component's skin class (as well as having a reference in the custom component class).  SparkSkin will automatically color transform (colorize) every child of the custom component's skin unless it is explicitly excluded.  Finally, back in the custom component, override partAdded() and when "closeButton" comes up, add the close button's event handler at that time.  Feels very Cairngorm-ey... but I digress (must suppress urge to rant about the stoopid that are "helper" classes).</p>
