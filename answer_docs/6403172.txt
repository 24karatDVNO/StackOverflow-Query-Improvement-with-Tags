<p>To add the source of my problem to @Mike's answer in case anyone else runs into a similar situation:  </p>

<p>I have an Eclipse project that has a dependency on another project.  Both projects have dependencies to a common library and I had inadvertently updated the library version on one project but not the other.  </p>
