<p>I received another error of the same format, but it had a referrer that says: <a href="http://app.bluetie.com/ca1759d5/gds/index_rich.php" rel="nofollow">http://app.bluetie.com/ca1759d5/gds/index_rich.php</a>. I am going to assume that these malformed URLs are coming from some kind of link-creating get rich quick scheme and just work to block them. They don't appear to be coming from users doing normal things on my site. If anyone has additional insight, I may still choose their answer to close the question, but otherwise, I'll close the question with this answer in a couple of days.</p>
