<pre><code>public static void Recursive(List&lt;string&gt; output){
        ...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The code in the block that refers to <code>output</code> will always be local &amp; not the member variable.</p>

<p>If you wish to refer to member variable, you could use <code>recursive.output</code>.</p>
