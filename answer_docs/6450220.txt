<p>If your cell value change every milisecond, you may have performance issues (or loops) with a vba event macro like Craig T showed.</p>

<p>You should probably add some checks on the update frequency and if you need to disable vba event, use :</p>

<pre><code>Application.EnableEvents = False
' Coding to skip these events
Application.EnableEvents = True
</code></pre>

<p>Regards,</p>
