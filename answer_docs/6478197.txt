<p>anyways i made it work using </p>

<pre><code>RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.*\.com/?.*|.*\.net/?.*)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ sites/$1/ [L]
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the slash in the end of the second line after <code>$1</code>.</p>

<p>i am pretty sure it wont work for any other server setup, so if you have a better solution,post it and i will accept it</p>

<p>@LazyOne thanks for your help</p>
