<p>If the view controller has been instantiated already i.e. it is below the current view controller in the navigation stack, you can consider <a href="http://iphonedevelopertips.com/objective-c/the-basics-of-protocols-and-delegates.html" rel="nofollow"><code>delegates</code></a> or <a href="http://iphonedevelopertips.com/cocoa/basics-of-notifications.html" rel="nofollow"><code>notifications</code></a>.</p>

<p>If it is yet to be created then save the image in an instance variable and pass it along when you push the next view controller. </p>
