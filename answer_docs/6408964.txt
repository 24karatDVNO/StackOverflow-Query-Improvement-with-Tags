<p>If you use only one thread on your pool, and your update/read happends in milliseconds, you do not need to do anything, and database take care of this synchronization.</p>

<p>If you use more than one thread on your pool, and your process takes too much time to complete, you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.mutex.aspx" rel="nofollow">Mutex</a> to synchronize them</p>

<p>If you use more than one server, you need to use a common directory, or database, with mutex together to lock and unlock process all together to all computers.</p>
