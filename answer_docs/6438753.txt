<p>I can't tell if this works for firebird, but you could try the following:</p>

<pre><code>procedimiento.prepare("BEGIN EXECUTE PROCEDURE AGREEGAR_UNO; END;");
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to the PL/SQL passage</p>

<pre><code>BEGIN
  EXECUTE PROCEDURE AGREEGAR_UNO;
END;
</code></pre>

<p>I am accessing Oracle databases with Qt and had to include the "BEGIN" and "END;" commands there. You don't have the "EXECUTE PROCEDURE" in oracle, but it might be required for Firebird.<br/>
Also, I am using Qt 4 so there might be a difference as well.</p>
