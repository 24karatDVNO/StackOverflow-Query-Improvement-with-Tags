<pre><code>SELECT startedCourse.School AS School, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN completedCourse IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS NotCompleted
FROM MyTable startedCourse
    LEFT OUTER JOIN MyTable completedCourse
        ON startedCourse.Status = 'S'
        AND completedCourse.Status = 'C'
        AND startedCourse.Course = completedCourse.Course
WHERE startedCourse.Date = ?
GROUP BY startedCourse.School
