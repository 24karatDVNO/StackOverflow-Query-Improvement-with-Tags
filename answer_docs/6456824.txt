<p>Not sure what language your using to do this.</p>

<p>But most languages have an indexof function.</p>

<p>var mystring - "cccctestoooabcccc";
var i = mystring.indexof("test");
var x = mystring.indexof("abc");</p>

<p>With those indexs you can use a function like substring(startindex, endindex);</p>

<p>Although, you will have to add or subtract the length of your string (test or abc)
Because the the index is of the first character location.
So
i = 4 and x = 11
you'd would want to pull the substring between ((i + "test".length), x)
Hopefully pull the substring "ooo"</p>

<p>This is rough, but should give you the general idea.</p>
