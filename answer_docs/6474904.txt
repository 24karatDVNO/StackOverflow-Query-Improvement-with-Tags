<p>If you've actually opened the table files in a hex or text editor, you'll see that you will definitely need the mysql application installed to make any sense of them to use them.  Sure the records are all there in plain text (.myd files for myisam, the ibdata1 file for innodb tables), but it would be a complete time-waster devising a custom app to parse or update the file structure, as well as trying to tie in table structure contained in the related files for each table.</p>
