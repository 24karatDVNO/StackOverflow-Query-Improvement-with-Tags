<p>The Code that calculate the Hash for the Object. 
I am taking all the Properties values, creating a string and then Hashing the string (I am doing this to know if I really need to save the information or the user just browsed). 
The issue is that I was using Reflection for the looping on all the properties, and this will cause a problem when you do this piece of code and you are using some inheritance.</p>
