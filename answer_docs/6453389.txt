<p>Because no one else get with better solution I´ll write here mine. As I wrote in Edit in question there were problem with SelectionMode as CellRange. I still don´t know how to "fix" it with this mode but I figure out how to do it with ListBox mode.</p>

<p>So in flexgrid change mode to ListBox. Then you can use this in your copy method:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (C1.Win.C1FlexGrid.Row item in _c1FlexGrid.Rows.Selected)
{
    if (!item.Visible)
       item.Selected = false;
}
Clipboard.SetDataObject(_c1FlexGrid.Clip);
</code></pre>

<p>I hope that this help someone else too :)</p>
