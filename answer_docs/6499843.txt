<p>Think of b and c as boxes pointing to different Book objects. Now when <code>c = b</code> is done the c box now points to whatever b is pointing to. So both b and c reference exactly the same object. More precisely c is now an alias for b when <code>c = b</code> is done. Assignment means c gets the value of b. Objects are stored as references in Java so c will just get the reference that is stored in b which will reference the Book object b is referencing. </p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
