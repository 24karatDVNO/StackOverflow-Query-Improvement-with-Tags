<p>You will, as Francois said, have to create a route for each category.  This can be slightly simplified with a simple array as below:</p>

<pre><code>$categories = array('cat1','cat2','etc...');

foreach($categories as $cat)
{
    $routes["$cat/(:any)"] = "category/$cat/\$1"
}
</code></pre>

<p>A possible alternative is to use a pre-controller hook in which you could query your database to see if the segment is a category and then direct the request appropriately.</p>

<p>If you'll have a lot of categories or they will be added to and updated frequently, I'd recommend the second option, otherwise, maintaining a simple array isn't too bad.</p>
