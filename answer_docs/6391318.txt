<p>Take a look at the php website, nearly all their entries have examples, the database stuff shows a while loop, this is the best way to do it..</p>

<p>write the table opening tag, plus any headers..</p>

<p>while able to get more database data, get it, and do</p>

<p>display the table row open tag
  display the row, by looping through the fields, and outputting them between cell tags 
dispaly the end of row tag</p>

<p>now you've finished with your data, write the end of the table</p>

<p>There are a lot of examples about.</p>

<p>for the looping through the field, thats why they invented a "foreach" , eg wether you have 0, or 10000, you can go through each one, even if its not consecutive, so for each "fruit" in apple, pear, bannana..</p>
