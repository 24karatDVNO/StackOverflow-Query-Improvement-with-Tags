<p>I agree with srboisvert. Don't do it on Windows. You can add Ubuntu (version of Linux) to Windows and have dual boot. It requires some work, but it is easier than going against the grain and trying to get everything working on Widows. </p>

<p>Ubuntu, Heroku and Git work wonderfully. Just know the learning curve is steep at first. Hire someone from Guru.com or Elance to help you. </p>

<p>Also, running Textmate on Mac is the preferred solution, so if you are considering getting a Mac or have access to one, that is the best thing to do. I don't think you need very much computing power...</p>

<p>Finally, my favorite book is Agile Web Development for Rails. Googling around doesn't work so well because most of the information is from old versions of Rails and is deprecated or doesn't work.</p>
