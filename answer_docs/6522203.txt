<p>Short of using a timer, I don't think you can with the effect library.  However, I recommend you look at <a href="http://www.greensock.com/tweenmax/" rel="nofollow">TweenMax</a>; it's an amazing animation library that is fast, efficient and has a lot of really cool options (like what you just said).</p>
