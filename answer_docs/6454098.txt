<p>I couldn't get that plugin to work and ended up going for solr-php-client from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/</a></p>

<p>It does everything you need it to and you can include_once it into your scripts and know that you can deploy them on a standard PHP installation.</p>
