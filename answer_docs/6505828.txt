<p>One alternative is to set menu with checkable actions to a button, as I've shown <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5226091/checkboxes-in-a-combobox-using-pyqt/5234662#5234662">here.</a><br>
Or you can change the selection model of the combo and control the hiding and showing of the pop up window as shown <a href="http://developer.qt.nokia.com/faq/answer/how_can_i_make_a_qcombobox_have_multiple_selection" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here.</a></p>
