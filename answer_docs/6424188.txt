<p>Assuming that the user has access to the header but not to the implementation, he/she hasn't got any idea how to handle the pointer. If your function is a source (aka allocate the pointer with new) you should return an auto_ptr. auto_ptr are: standard, never throws and specifically design to do this job.</p>
