<p>I would:</p>

<ul>
<li>change the visible state after first click (some kind of unobtrusive overlay or a "working" spinner, change the CSS property of the cursor to "busy" etc). This way, you're providing some indication to the user that "something is happening". </li>
<li><strong>In addition</strong> to that, ignore further clicks on the link until the action completes</li>
</ul>
