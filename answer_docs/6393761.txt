<p>You can use iis7 failed request logs to track which handler is causing pages to fail out. Using this approach, you can narrow down where the issue is happening, and then use asp.net page level tracking and exception stack traces in your event log to solve the problem. Also, good logging in your global.asax application_error method is always recommended.</p>
