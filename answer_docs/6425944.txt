<p>We use a migration tool (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/migratordotnet/" rel="nofollow">migratordotnet</a> - other alternatives exist) that lets you write C# classes that execute database commands. The migrations run locally on each invocation of the program or of the integration tests, and on the servers on each deployment. The migration framework automatically keeps track of which migrations have been applied. Of course, the migrations are a part of the version control repository.</p>
