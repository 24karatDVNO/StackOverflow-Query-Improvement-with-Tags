<p>If you have elements with class Sales and Acct, this should work in IE.
Remember that css is case sensitive. So class names must match.</p>

<pre><code>    if (dept == "All") {
        $('.Sales').show();
        $('.Acct').show();
    }
    else if (dept == "Sales") {
        $('.Sales').show();
        $('.Acct').hide();
    }
</code></pre>
