<p>Declaration like that automatically calls the default constructor (i.e. with no argument or with all arguments have default value). The compiler would create it automatically when your class doesn't have any constructor, but since you have one, then it won't be created automatically. Therefore, the declaration fails because it can't find the default constructor.</p>
