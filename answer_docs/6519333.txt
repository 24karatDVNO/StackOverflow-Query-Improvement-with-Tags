<p>If you just want to count the rows and exit the loop when you've done 50, you could use something like:</p>

<pre><code>my $count = 0;
while(*row is found* &amp;&amp; $count++ &lt; 50)
{
    *stuff*
}
</code></pre>

<p>But using SQL <code>LIMIT</code> or the like is better if it works in your case.</p>
