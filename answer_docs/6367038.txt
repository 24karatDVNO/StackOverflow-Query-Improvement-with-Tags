<p>Red Gate Reflector also has an analysis tool that will find all callers (via static analysis, you don't have to interrupt the program with a breakpoint).  It used to be free but isn't any longer (If you write .NET software for a living, the $35 is well worth it.  For open source hobbyists, not so much.).  I'm not sure if the free clone ILSpy has that ability.</p>
