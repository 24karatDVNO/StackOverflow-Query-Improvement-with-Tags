<p>I remember that Acrobat reader used to include some ActiveX PDF reader object available for further use with Microsoft Office. Other companies have developed similar products, some of them (in their basic form) even available for free. </p>

<p>That could be a solution, couldn't it? You'd have then to check that your activeX PDF reader supports direct page access in its methods, and distribute it with your apps, or have it installed on your user's computers. It will avoid you all the overhead related to acrobat readers versions follow-up, specially when newer versions will be available on the market and you'll have to update your client interface.   </p>
