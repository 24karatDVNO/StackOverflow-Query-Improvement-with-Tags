<p>I have try that add a arugument, but it is still not worked.</p>

<p>I create a new project and use a no-argument function to response Notification, it is worked normally.</p>

<p>The reason why I cannot receive the Notification is that a removeObserver method was called at one part which I didn't notice.</p>

<p>Thanks for all your reply.</p>
