<p>Firstly, are you placing the buttons using Interface Builder? </p>

<p>If so, I'd recommend placing numbered tags for each of the buttons and then you can use something like the following to find the appropriate buttons and remove the background image.</p>

<pre><code> for(UIButton *buttonname in [yourView subViews]){
        if (buttonname.tag == 2 || buttonname.tag == 3 || buttonname.tag == 4) {
            [buttonname setBackgroundImage:nil forState:UIControlStateNormal];
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If you're creating them programmatically and sequentially, I'd recommend placing the buttons in an array as they're made and just remove the background of the buttons using "objectAtIndex".</p>
