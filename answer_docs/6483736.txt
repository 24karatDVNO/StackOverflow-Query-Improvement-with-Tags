<p>Doh... fixed - totally my own fault.</p>

<p><strong>I had set up my html.dropdownlistfor like so</strong>
@Html.DropDownListFor(x=>x.Name,</p>

<p><strong>When it should've been like so:</strong>
@Html.DropDownListFor(x=>x.DockTemplateColumn.Id,</p>

<p>Setting the first argument to x=>x.DockTemplateColumn.Id (which uniquely identifies the items in my list) instead of x.Name fixed the issue straight away.</p>

<p>Just thought I'd post it here in case someone else makes the same mistake I did.</p>
