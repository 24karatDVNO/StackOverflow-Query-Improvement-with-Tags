<p>Have you looked at the OOTB nmap option to do this?
nmap has an option to read the IP address list from a file which you can read more about <a href="http://nmap.org/book/man-target-specification.html" rel="nofollow">here</a> on the nmap website.</p>

<p>The specific option to look for is this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>-iL  (Input from list)</p>
  
  <p>Reads target specifications from . Passing a huge list
  of hosts is often awkward on the
  command line, yet it is a common
  desire. For example, your DHCP server
  might export a list of 10,000 current
  leases that you wish to scan. Or maybe
  you want to scan all IP addresses
  except for those to locate hosts using
  unauthorized static IP addresses.
  Simply generate the list of hosts to
  scan and pass that filename to Nmap as
  an argument to the -iL option. Entries
  can be in any of the formats accepted
  by Nmap on the command line (IP
  address, hostname, CIDR, IPv6, or
  octet ranges). Each entry must be
  separated by one or more spaces, tabs,
  or newlines. You can specify a hyphen
  (-) as the filename if you want Nmap
  to read hosts from standard input
  rather than an actual file.</p>
  
  <p>The input file may contain comments that start with # and extend to the end of the line.</p>
