<p>in duplicate column you want to put 'N' when the value is not unique.. means value of column Country having duplicate record then you want to put N (No)</p>

<p>any way you can use following query easily to perform this task </p>

<pre><code>update newTable  
set DUPLICATE =
case
when country in (select country from newTable group by country having count(*) &gt; 1) then 
'N' -- if you got my previous point then you have to edit this line with 'Y'
else
'Y'
end;
</code></pre>
