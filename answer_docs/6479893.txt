<p>first you get the selected value text from the <code>listbox</code> then </p>

<p>Read the whole file into <code>memory</code> (e.g.
   with <code>File.ReadAllLines</code>) Remove the
   offending line based on the value of <code>listbox</code> (in this case it's
   probably easiest to convert the
   string array into a <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> then
   remove the line) Write all the rest
   of the lines back (e.g. with
   <code>File.WriteAllLines</code>) - potentially
   convert the <code>List&lt;string&gt;</code> into a
   string array again using <code>ToArray</code> That
   means you have to know that you've
   got enough memory though.</p>
