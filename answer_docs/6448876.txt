<p>@hakre Finally this problem is solved by hacking phpsrc/sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c.
The reason is that php's echo and printf functions' behavior are controlled
by different sapis, like cgi, cli, the sapi determines where the destination
is. Modules are not able to change the destination.</p>

<p>In cgi_main.c, the original work flow is:</p>

<pre><code>listen();
while (req = accept()) {
    php_request_start();
    php_execute_script();
    php_request_shutdown();
}
</code></pre>

<p>All I did is move the request start and shutdown out of the while loop,</p>

<pre><code>listen();
php_request_start();
while (req = accept()) {
    php_execute_script();
}
php_request_shutdown();
</code></pre>

<p>It works fine and the "require_onced-files" will be loaded only once.</p>
