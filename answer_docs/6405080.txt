<p>You can write a quick code to do that. The least-squares solution to the problem is b = (G^(T)G)^(-1)G^(T)m, where b is the vector of coefficients of the linear fit, m is the vector of all y values and G is the kernel matrix of dimension (length(m),2) and each row of G is (1, x) where x is the x value corresponding to a y value. G^T is the transpose of G.</p>

<p>The transpose and inversion can be done by using LAPACK library (or any other linear algebra library of your choice) or by taking the appropriate code from a Numerical Recipes book. </p>
