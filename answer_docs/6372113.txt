<p>This is your solution:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM 
(
    SELECT *
    FROM `your_table`
    ORDER BY `task_time` DESC
) `TT`
GROUP BY `TT`.`task_id`;
</code></pre>

<p>Please note to change in the above query, <code>your_table</code> with your table name and <code>task_id</code>, <code>task_time</code> with your respective ID and time columns.</p>

<p>Also, please note that the above query might run slow if the table has many, many entries, say a million rows.</p>

<p>Let me know if above is the query you were willing to ask.</p>
