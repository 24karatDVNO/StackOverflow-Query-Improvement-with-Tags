<p>If you could further restrict things so that only objects that implement ISerializable are allowed then you could use generics to get compile-time checking</p>

<pre><code>public void Serialize&lt;T&gt;(T obj) where T : ISerializable
{
    // Do work
}
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately this doesn't count as an answer to your question because not every <code>Serializable</code> class implements <code>ISerializable</code></p>
