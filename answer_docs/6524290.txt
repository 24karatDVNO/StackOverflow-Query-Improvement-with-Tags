<p>Just to take a different view here - why are you bothered about this? How much memory are you using? It looks like you're trying to optimise something - but if there are only a few rows (i.e. less than a few hundred) - I can't see why you're getting worked up about this.</p>

<p>Do you have a problem, or are you imagining one?</p>
