<p>You can test for a state change by doing the following in the Observable class:</p>

<pre><code>public void update(Observable o, Object arg)
{
    if(o.hasChanged())
    {
        // do something
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The observers that listen to anything don't need this test. This is probably the easiest way if you only want to listen for state changes.</p>
