<p>Instead of using environment variable use JNA. It is easier than JNI and reliable method to communicate with the program. Another approach is you use Message Queue like <a href="http://activemq.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">ActiveMQ</a> for which C API also available and this is open source. It will decouple the application.</p>
