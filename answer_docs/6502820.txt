<p>There are two things associated with your xml.</p>

<ol>
<li>Will the xml always be the same as you posted and you are interested in the value from the last tag?</li>
<li>If its not going to be same then what is the value you will be interested in?</li>
</ol>

<p>For 1 - You can simply parse and use the last found character for the value tag as your output.</p>

<p>For 2 - You will have to find a way where you can identify which value you would want to parse. In this case the xml will need to be edited , either modify your tag or add a attribute.</p>

<p>Drop a comment in case you need more info.</p>
