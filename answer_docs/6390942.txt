<p>If padding is working better than margin, it won't do much harm to use that instead.</p>

<p>I saw this behavior in your example markup until I added a little text inside <code>&lt;div id="menu"&gt;</code> so as to make it not empty, and then margin worked exactly as expected.</p>

<p>Another possible workaround is to set a minimum height on the div's, though I haven't tested that.</p>
