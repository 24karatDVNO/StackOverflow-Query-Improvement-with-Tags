<p>Tested on a real device (HTC Magic, OS 1.6), it detects DST for Brussels/CEST even in 1970. So this is another example of different behaviour between emulator and real devices.</p>

<p>I'm going to test it again on a more recent device, to see if it there are different TZ databases across OS versions. </p>

<p>UPDATE
Tested on Samsung Galaxy Tab (OS 2.2), same behaviour than HTC.</p>
