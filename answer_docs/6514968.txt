<p>If you simply want to know when your Activity is no longer visible, override the onPause() and/or onStop() methods.</p>

<p>If you want to start doing something in the background at this point, you could create a <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Service</a>.  A Service will run in the background, unlike an Activity which is more likely to be killed.</p>

<p>If you want to send some data to this Service from your Activity, you can use Intents and Extras.  If you want to send more than the simple types of data you can send with extras, use the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Application</a> class.
