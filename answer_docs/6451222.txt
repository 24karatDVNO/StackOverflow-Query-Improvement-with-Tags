<p>Regarding complexity O(n/2+1) and space complexity O(1) you can (almost) meet the requirements with this approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Compare tuples:</p>
  
  <p>a[x] == a[x+1], a[x+2] == a[x+3] ... a[n-1] == a[n]</p>
  
  <p>If no match is found increase step:</p>
  
  <p>a[x] == a[x+2], a[x+1] == a[x+3]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This will in worst case run in O(n/2+2) (but always in O(1) space) when you have an array like this: <code>[8 1 10 1 3 1 4 1]</code></p>
