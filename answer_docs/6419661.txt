<p>From MSDN for <a href="http://207.46.16.248/en-us/library/gg671236%28VS.103%29.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>DbExtensions.Include()</code></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The path expression must be composed
  of simple property access expressions
  together with calls to Select in order
  to compose additional includes after
  including a collection property.</p>
