<p>I have found this by exporting the SQLite DB that I found in the simulator's Application-Document directory.</p>

<pre><code>ls  ~/Library/Application\ Support/iPhone\ Simulator/4.3/Applications/64A2DBF0-CBCC-4975-8366-0EC800D1D1F7/Documents/MyApplication.sqlite
</code></pre>

<p>Partial dump:</p>

<pre><code>"Z_VERSION","Z_UUID","Z_PLIST"
"1","A6722D4A-3DBB-4D48-8356-D173A1C288AA","bpl .... (etc)
</code></pre>

<p>Is this value managed in the NSManagedObject ??</p>
