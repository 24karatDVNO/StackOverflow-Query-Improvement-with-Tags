<p>I think it would be pretty useful to use mcv in your project instead!</p>

<p>You have to store somewhere the input data of your charts so a model object would be ideal for that.</p>

<p>The view class would be a template for the boxes and every instance would have is coordinates.</p>

<p>Separating the data from the boxes view would allow you in the future to change aspect and behaviour of the box view without having to touch the data. </p>

<p>In the end you have to consider the mvc pattern not as something that help you build your application in the current state, but a way to have a clean design that you can change and improve without having to rewrite everything. So if you want to build an app that is going to grow go with MVC.</p>
