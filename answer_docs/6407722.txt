<p>The most likely translation you'd want to do (this looks like some kind of lowlevel parsing; for scanning of binary byte arrays, 'unsigned char' would have been expected):</p>

<pre><code>byte[] s; // with some kind of value
for (int i=0; i&lt;s.Length; i++)
{
     if (s[i] == 0x0){ //Some more code}   
     if ((s[i] &amp; mask) != 0x0){ //Some Code}
}
</code></pre>
