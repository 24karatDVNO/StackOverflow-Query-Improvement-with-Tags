<p>You need some joins:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT watchedItems.id
FROM watchedItems
left join globalItems on watchedItems.bidGroupID = bidGroups.bidGroupID 
left join bidGroups on watchedItems.aid = globalItems.aid
WHERE (watchedItems.bidGroupID IS NULL OR bidGroups.bidGroupQty &gt; 0)
AND watchedItems.maxPrice &gt; globalItems.currentPrice
</code></pre>

<p>You were getting duplicates because there were three rows in the bidGroups table.</p>
