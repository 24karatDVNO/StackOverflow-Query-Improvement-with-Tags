<p>It depends on your audience. If you have experienced developers such tricks are acceptable. A new developer will definitely get confused by the first example.</p>

<p>A good guide is this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would you know a week from now what the code does? Yes -> Ok</li>
<li>Do you need to comment what it does? Yes -> Not Ok</li>
<li>Will there be new developers in the team that might not understand this code? Yes -> Not Ok</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end its your call. I would understand and accept the first example.</p>
