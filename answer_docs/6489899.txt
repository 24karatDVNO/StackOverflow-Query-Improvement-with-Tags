<p>Well First of all a JavaScript is just like any other Object in object oriented programming.</p>

<p>And as RobG said JSON is effectively an object literal in Javascript Notation. But Not exactly.
According to a Javascript book it says this is an object defined by using Object Notation:</p>

<pre><code>var newObject = 
{     prop1 : true,     
showMessage : function (msg) {alert(msg)} 
}; 
</code></pre>

<p>According to JSON in JavaScript,</p>

<p>JSON is a subset of the object literal notation of JavaScript.</p>
