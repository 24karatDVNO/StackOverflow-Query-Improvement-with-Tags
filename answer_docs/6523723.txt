<p>I suspect that the problem is that your <code>chart</code> view is persisting for longer than your Activity, and is therefore being added to a parent multiple times without being removed when the parent is destroyed. It's difficult to be certain without seeing more of your code.</p>

<p>You could try adding an <code>onDestroy()</code> method which removes it:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
void onDestroy()
{
    ((LinearLayout)findViewById(R.id.chart_area)).removeView( chart );
}
</code></pre>

<p>Alternatively, you could try instantiating a new <code>chart</code> in <code>onCreate()</code>. </p>
