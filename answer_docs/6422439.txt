<p>You can <em>automate</em> the creation of email id's but creating a <em>http-client</em> that is logging into you cpanel-interface and then performing the needed <em>http-requests</em> to create the email-ids (email accounts).</p>

<p>Something similar <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6321310/applying-htaccess-folder-username-password-with-php">has been asked by Iain Clark</a> (Applying .htaccess folder username/password with PHP).</p>

<p>If you write such an automation in PHP you can then create Email-IDs from your PHP script.</p>

<p>Code for similar tasks can be found here and there in the web (e.g. <a href="http://www.thelinuxblog.com/php-script-to-log-into-cpanel/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">PHP Script To Log Into cPanel</a>), however you should carefully check if that is dealing with your passwords appropriate and that it actually works for your version/style/theme of cpanel.</p>
