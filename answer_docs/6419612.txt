<p>Assuming a large number of bits in your parsing distance then you have to bit pack.
Think circular buffers to enable continuous operation.
Low bit error rate premise and high entropy data (ie a byte may take all values not just a few symbols) then a union based decoding should be better. Either prep bits with shifts before the union or define eight unions one shift apart and call them as required.</p>
