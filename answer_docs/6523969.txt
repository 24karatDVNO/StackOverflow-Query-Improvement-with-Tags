<p>As long as your device can install apps from non-market sources, you can simply put your APK file somewhere accessible to a web browser, then browse to it from the device, which should cause it to be downloaded. Once it's downloaded, selecting it (using a file explorer app) will cause it to be installed.</p>

<p>You can't debug this way, but if you have something like aLogCat loaded you can view your app's log messages.</p>
