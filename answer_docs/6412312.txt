<p>As a more concrete example, I have a case where, after the application has launched, I'm actually not quite ready for the user to see what is happening on the screen.  In this case, I have a webview that is still rendering, so I overlay the the Default.png file onto my view while some junk happens in the background.</p>

<pre><code>// put the default image over the whole screen while we wait for the html to load
UIImageView * defaultImageView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage: [UIImage imageNamed:@"Default.png"]] ;
[self.view addSubview:defaultImageView];  


// adjust for status bar
if(![[UIApplication sharedApplication] isStatusBarHidden]) {//http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5310975/iphone-view-and-statusbar
    CGRect imageRect = defaultImageView.frame;
    imageRect.origin.y = imageRect.origin.y - 20;
    defaultImageView.frame = imageRect;
  }

Now, later in the code, remove the subview....
