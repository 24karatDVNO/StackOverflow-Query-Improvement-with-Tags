<p>My understanding is that Microsoft hasn't released a vcredist_x86.exe for this version.  They did, however, release Merge Modules with this version, so you should download them and include them in your installer.  Now where do you get these is also a good question, but I somehow magically got them, probably through InstallShield update.</p>
