<p>Your code above is correct, and should work fine. Perhaps you might not have evaluated <code>velocityOut</code> before trying to use it in <code>fopen</code>. So if you are working from the command window, you'll need to evaluate it first, or if it's in a script, it should be defined <em>prior</em> to being used in <code>fopen</code>.</p>
