<p>Compare times server side of two requests from the same client.</p>

<p>How about a simple ajax query that requests a URL for the content?  Just record the time server side of the first request with the ip of the client store it somewhere (file or database) and then compare it to the time of the request from the client-side javascript and deliver a URL after comparing the two times pick an arbitrary "fast" or "slow" time limit and deliver the URL for the content of the appropriate speed.</p>
