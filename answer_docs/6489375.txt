<p>FlatteningPathIterator</p>

<p>From comment
 * The <code>FlatteningPathIterator</code> class returns a flattened view of
 * another {@link PathIterator} object.  Other {@link java.awt.Shape Shape} 
 * classes can use this class to provide flattening behavior for their paths
 * without having to perform the interpolation calculations themselves.</p>
