<p>Jez, </p>

<p>I know I was having the same problem with the "A program is trying to access e-mail addresses you have stored in Outlook. Do you want to allow this?" error message, and I think your problem is the following line of code:</p>

<pre><code>objOutlook = new Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.Application(); //create it
</code></pre>

<p>Instead, try changing it to the following</p>

<pre><code>objOutlook = Globals.ThisAddIn.Application(); //get current Outlook object
</code></pre>

<p>I think that should help you avoid that error message, or at least, that's what fixed it for me! :-)</p>

<p>Good luck! :-)</p>
