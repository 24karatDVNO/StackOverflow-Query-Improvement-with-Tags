<p>Use Express Checkout and DoDirectPayment (Website Payments Pro). Express Checkout gives you the redirect-to-PayPal-and-login functionality, whereas DoDirectPayment allows you to take card payments directly on your site.<br>
In addition, you can override the PayPal Profile shipping address of the buyer by specifying ADDROVERRIDE=1 in the SetExpressCheckout API call. Remember you'll need to pass in the appropriate shipping address details information as well.  </p>
