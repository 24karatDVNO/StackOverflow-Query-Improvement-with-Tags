<p>I would use tabs- no need to have a separate button if the plan name can be the tab name.</p>

<p>Design should almost always focus on usability and it seems like this approach would serve that goal well.</p>

<p>If your list of plans; however, is dynamic or can grow overtime then I would go with a dropdown populated with the list and a button that gets the details or wire up on onchange event and get the data.</p>

<p>The question is a bit vague so maybe if you provided more information we could better help you here.</p>
