<p><a href="http://ryanbigg.com" rel="nofollow">Ryan Bigg</a> has a very nice tutorial called <a href="http://ryanbigg.com/2010/12/ubuntu-ruby-rvm-rails-and-you/" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu, Ruby, RVM, Rails and You</a>. Since you're configuring a server you will probably have a look at some <a href="https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/deployment/best-practices/" rel="nofollow">tips about deployment &amp; best practices</a> written by the creator of RVM himself.  </p>

<p>I'm sure you have it done already though since it's an old question, but I the links will be of use to someone else.</p>
