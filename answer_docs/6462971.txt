<p>You are using Flash 8, so the code embed suggestion above won't work. You can only embed fonts which selected characters. From what i remember Flash 8 doesn't has a panel to select characters to be embed, in that case, just create a dummy dynamic textfield and fill it with all the characters you need.</p>

<p>Remember not to select use device fonts, any other options will works.</p>
