<p>I don't think there is any way to do so as there is no event available which can give you the control of 'View' or 'Close' button action.You should try to find some another way.UIAlertView with timer can be one way if I am not misunderstanding your problem.There you get a delegate method which can be used to close the alert programatically.</p>
