<p>Android apps use <code>"/data/data/YOUR_PACKAGE/databases/"</code> as the database folder. When you will create you class that extends <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code>, it will look for your table in this folder. </p>

<p>The sdcard could be used to store additional data, but as you said, not all android devices have one. </p>
