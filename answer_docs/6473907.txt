<p>Hi There are multiple ways to create a db using SQLite, as you know SQLite is very lightweight and very flexible of datastorage, the commands also are very easy to remember.</p>

<p>I am a Windows XP User.</p>

<p>In my system i have extracted the SQLite engine 3.X to <strong>C:\Ronald\Personal\epmc\JavaJ2EE</strong></p>

<p>u can some Editor like <strong>SQLiteBrowser</strong>, its very nice to work with. no extra framwork needed.</p>

<p>Open a command prompt and point to the SQLite engine.</p>

<p>In my case it was <strong>C:\Ronald\Personal\epmc\JavaJ2EE</strong> </p>

<p>give the following command to create a DB</p>

<pre><code>          sqlite3.exe TestDB.db;
</code></pre>

<p>Once u give this automatically the database file will be created in the particular location.
Then start creating tables like what you have done in Oracle or MySQL.</p>

<p>Thanks
