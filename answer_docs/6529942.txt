<p>Ofcourse it would be much easier to export the data later from a DB, or use it straight from the DB without exporting it. However, yours is not a stupid plan, since you will have the email addresses. They will just be a little harder to extract from mail - depending on how many you will have to extract, you might need to create a script that reads your gmail address, extracts all the emails that match a pattern, parse their text and extract the emails - not quite rocket science, bu definitely harder than doing a simple select on a table</p>
