<p>The NSSortDescriptor is usually used to sort objects of a class. You pass the name of the property in that class to be compared with others.
Since what you have in your array actually seems to be a NSDictionary, the NSSortDescriptor might not be the best way to approach this problem. Besides, your objects in the dictionary must have a type, so I would try to sort the array myself in one of the classic methods if I were you. </p>
