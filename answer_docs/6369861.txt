<p>Sometimes, and especially with databases, just cleaning doesn't work!!!</p>

<p>Go to the dir: /Users/qjsi/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/4.3/Applications</p>

<p>There, you'll find all the projects you've run. Find the folder containing the project your working on, and delete it. Then clean your project through Xcode, then run. The folder in that dir will be recreated, and so will the database.</p>

<p>NOTE: The database will be removed as well! If you have it saved in your bundle and copy it to an editable directory, please note that the database will be the same as the one in your bundle (so, without altered records made in the iPhone Simulator).</p>
