<p>Looks ok to me.</p>

<p>You have some other error though: <code>fileNameBufferSize</code> is supposed to be the size of the <code>szFileName</code> buffer (1024 in your code). You didn't fill it, which means it's trash, be careful with that.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong></p>

<p>Yep, you should check the <code>malloc</code> returned value for NULL, forgot to mention that.</p>
