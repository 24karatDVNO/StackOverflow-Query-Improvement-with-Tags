<p>Your OO design is poor: you should not have a <code>AccountGrp[]</code>, it should be a class instead, with nicely named attributes..  Your code would be much more readable and maintainable.</p>

<p>If you want to stick with your current design, you should at least split your <code>popAccAttr</code> method.  I don't see the need to put 3 completely different methods inside one, with a case switch.</p>

<pre><code>public static AccountGrp[] popAccArr(IncomingObject incObject) {
  AccountGrp[] accountGrp = new AccountGrp[noAccounts];
  accountGrp[0] = popAccClient(incObject);
  accountGrp[1] = popAccBroker(incObject);
  accountGrp[2] = popAccError(incObject);
  return AccountGrpArr;
}
</code></pre>
