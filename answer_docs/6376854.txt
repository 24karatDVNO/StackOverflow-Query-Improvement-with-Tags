<p>SQL tables aren't inherently ordered - they effectively behave like a "bag of rows". If you want the results in a specific order, you will need to sort them (using <code>ORDER BY ...</code>) when you pull them out of the bag -- otherwise, the SQL server will return them in whatever order it feels is easiest. (In this case, they're coming out in the reverse order you inserted them, but that's not guaranteed at all.)</p>
