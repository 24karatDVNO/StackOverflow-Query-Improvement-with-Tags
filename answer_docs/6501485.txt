<p>If by subtitle you mean secondary text you can't use <code>UITableViewCellStyleDefault</code> this cell style <em>only</em> has one text string and one optional image, if you want secondary text you need to look at the documentation for UITableViewCell under the cell styles section and pick the style that you are looking for (http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewCell_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/c/tdef/UITableViewCellStyle). You might also want to take a look at some of the iOS5 table view stuff, there <em>might</em> be something that would allow you to take more control of the way the cells look.</p>
