<p>You can use Q objects to combine queries. In you case your query might look as follows:</p>

<pre><code>from django.db.models import Q

test_logs = InspectorTestLog.objects.fiter(Q(status__status='Open') | Q(status__status='Under Process'))
</code></pre>

<p>This will retrieve all test_logs with a status of 'Open' or 'Under Process' (and by default exclude those with a status of 'Closed'.)</p>

<p>You could also write a query that just excludes test_logs with a 'Closed' status, which would accomplish the same thing:</p>

<pre><code>test_logs = InspectorTestLog.objects.exclude(status__status='Closed')
</code></pre>
