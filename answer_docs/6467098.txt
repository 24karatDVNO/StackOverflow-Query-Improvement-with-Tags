<p>I have an update. I fixed the issue, although I am not sure why I had to go through this trouble. </p>

<p>I had to regenerate a new xorg.conf file in /etc/X11 folder by using the command "<code>sudo Xorg -configure</code>" after exiting X. Then, I opened the file and added a line in the "Monitor" section that says </p>

<pre><code>Option      "metamodes" "CRT-0: 1600x1200"
</code></pre>

<p>and I restarted the machine. Presto! My widescreen is back with the higher resolution. </p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
