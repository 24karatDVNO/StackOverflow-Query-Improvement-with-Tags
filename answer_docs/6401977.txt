<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb126445.aspx" rel="nofollow">T4 Templates</a> might help. They let you create a ".tt" file, that when changed, will rebuild a code file.</p>

<p>There are a few different ways of using them ("Text Template" vs "Preprocessed Text Template"), but you can probably do what you need. By default, VS doesn't give any intellisense/syntax highlighting for them, but there are some VS addins that do that.</p>
