<p>For basic introduction to designing a layout, the developer tutorials on the android developer website should be good enough. You do not need to know anything about xml in order to learn about designing a layout. If xml proves to be such a big headache, you can always use the graphic tool to place buttons on the UI. The xml code will be generated automatically. You can find this feature in Eclipse IDE in the tab right next to the xml file where it is displayed.</p>
