<p>Due to the stateless nature of the web it is not possible to know exactly when the user left your website. So you can't really trigger any code to change the mentioned value. </p>

<p>As the other have said one has to store the time-since-last-activity to get an approximate idea when was the last time the user was actually doing something with the website.</p>

<p>HTH :)</p>
