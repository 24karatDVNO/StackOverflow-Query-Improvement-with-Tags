<p>The iScroll library would probably really help you.  Although, it is more geared toward fixing the overflow:scroll problem, it also should solve this problem.  It doesn't update with any DOM change, though.  You'll have to code for it to refresh and/or destroy and recreate the iscroll object on any DOM change.</p>

<p>Though I haven't tested it myself, it sounds like it should do what you want.</p>
