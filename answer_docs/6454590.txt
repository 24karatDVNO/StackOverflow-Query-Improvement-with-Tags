<p>Reddit itself uses Cassandra.  If you want something  "similar to reddit.com," maybe you should look at their source -- <a href="https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Here's what David King (ketralnis) <a href="https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/the_apache_software_foundation_announces9" rel="nofollow">said earlier this year</a> about the Cassandra 0.7 release: "Running any large website is a constant race between scaling your user base and scaling your infrastructure to support it.  Our traffic more than tripled this year, and the transparent scalability afforded to us by Apache Cassandra is in large part what allowed us to do it on our limited resources. Cassandra v0.7 represents the real-life operations lessons learned from installations like ours and provides further features like column expiration that allow us to scale even more of our infrastructure."</p>

<p>However, Rick Branson <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2686835" rel="nofollow">notes</a> that Reddit doesn't take full advantage of Cassandra's features, so if you were to start from scratch, you'd want to do some things differently.</p>
