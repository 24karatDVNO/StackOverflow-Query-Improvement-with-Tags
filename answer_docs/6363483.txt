<li>If I calculated correctly 1.6sec, 4 3 5 5 6 # 9 6 7 5 3</li>
<li><p>There are many options, one which comes to mind:</p>

<pre><code>var KeyMap = new Dictionary&lt;char, List&lt;char&gt;&gt;
             {
                 { '1', new List&lt;char&gt;(), },   // at least on my phone 1 has no characters assigned
                 { '2', new List&lt;char&gt; { 'a', 'b', 'c' } },
               ...
             };
</code></pre>

<p>Basically each button on the phone is map to a list of assigned characters. You can then provide some UI to configure the dictionary (make sure no double mappings etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming you are using Visual Studio: Have a look around for ASP.NET MVC tutorials on the net. There are plenty around.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You should encapsulate the core of your application (button mapping and calculation of times and sequences) so that you can use it with any UI you like.</p>
