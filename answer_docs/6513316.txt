<p>I think there are two different schools of thought here. The one as shown by Jarek Potiuk that prefers to use for/while loops for different purposes, ie. a for loop should be used when you know the range of your loop in advance (for (;i &lt; arr.length(); i++)) while a while is preferred for unlimited situations.</p>

<p>But then there's the other line of thought that uses only one kind of loop and at that the for loop because it's more versatile. The Java SDK for example uses for loops pretty extensively in unlimited situations (eg linked lists).
But then you should really write the for loop like Bohemian does - much clearer.</p>
