<p>My stupid mistake!</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with the code I showed you but I discovered that I was calling 
<code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="js/jquery-1.6.1.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code>in the head and only the "js/jquery-1.6.1.min.js" script existed on my server.</p>

<p>Feel stupid now but thanks all who contributed.</p>

<p>Cheers
Rog</p>
