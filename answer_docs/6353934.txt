<p>Thanks to Cordsen for pointing me in the right direction here.</p>

<p>I used your suggested solution with a slight amendment and it is working OK so far!</p>

<p>I found that I was getting more and more nested <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> tags in the final XML so I deleted the existing <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> node first and then appended the new one:</p>

<pre><code>    frmDescription = Request.Form("description")
    'Line breaks in the form are coming across as &lt;br&gt; instead of &lt;br /&gt;'
    frmDescription = replace(frmDescription, "&lt;br&gt;", "&lt;br /&gt;")

    Set formDescriptionXML = Server.CreateObject("MSXML2.DOMDocument")
    formDescriptionXML.loadXML frmDescription
    If Not formDescriptionXML Is Nothing Then
        'Remove the existing description node'
        Set objRemove = objSaleItem.SelectSingleNode("description")
        objSaleItem.removeChild objRemove
        'Create the new description node '
        objSaleItem.appendChild formDescriptionXML.documentElement
    End If
</code></pre>

<p>I still need to do a bit of work to nake sure I always only have one <code>&lt;description&gt;</code> node but I have solved the worst bit.</p>

<p>Thanks very much!
