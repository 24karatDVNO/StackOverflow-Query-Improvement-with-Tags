<p>AfterLogic does offer royalty-free developer licenses for WebMail Pro. Just not directly from the web site (as you must first confirm you won't develop a competing software). You can contact AfterLogic for further details.</p>

<p>If you just need to edit the source code but have no plans to re-distribute the modified software to third parties (i.e. all you need is to run the software on your server), that's allowed by any license.</p>

<p>In other words, all licenses are developer licenses (but not all are royalty-free).</p>
