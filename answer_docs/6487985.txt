<p>You added the parameters, opened the connection but forgot to execute the command. Put</p>

<pre><code>command.ExecuteNonQuery();
</code></pre>

<p>before your alert box.</p>

<p>As an added bonus you'll probably want to wrap things in a using statement. This will ensure your objects are disposed of properly and your connection is closed;</p>

<pre><code>using (MySqlConnection connection = new MySqlConnection(MyConString))
{
    using (MySqlCommand command = connection.CreateCommand())
    {
       command.Connection = connection;
       /// the rest of your database code goes here
       command.ExecuteNonQuery();
}

MessageBox.Show("Data Saved");
</code></pre>
