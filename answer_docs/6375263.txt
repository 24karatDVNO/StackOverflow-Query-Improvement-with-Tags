<p>You don't need to escape any of the characters, providing you can type it on your keyboard, and the tools used to edit and display the HTML files don't destroy them (because they aren't Unicode compatible for example). However with many characters it's easier to, say, type &emdash; than try and work out how to type it.</p>
