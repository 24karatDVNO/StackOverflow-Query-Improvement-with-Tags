<p>To solve this, simple have the z-index of the sortable below that of the non-dragged elements. Then bind a mouseover event on the elements that needs to be hovered for your custom actions. So because the z-index of the non-dragged items is higher, the mouseover event will always be triggered. So, hover events on sorting draggables :)</p>
