<p>Did you try that query on the <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/fql.query/" rel="nofollow">FQL query tester tool</a>?  If that does return values but your application doesn't, then it is probably due to lack of extended permissions.  You would first need to prompt the user for <code>read_requests</code> extended permissions.</p>

<p>Note: you can also use where <code>uid_to = me()</code> to get the current user. </p>
