<p>Yes, it's certainly possible to use a sprite on an <code>input</code>, but I'd strongly suggest against it if you care about browser compatibility.  Background images on <code>input</code> elements in Internet Explorer 7, for example, don't stay in a fixed position so as you type, the background image will move.  If you're using a horizontal sprite, that could be especially problematic.  I'd suggest putting the <code>input</code> in a container element that has the background.  And to that end, make sure there's extra room surrounding each image for browser and device inconsistencies with form element spacing/heights/margins/padding.  Using a reset CSS stylesheet would be helpful at the start.  And test and test again!</p>
