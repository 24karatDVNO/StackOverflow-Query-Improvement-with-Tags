<p>If you add Zend_Cache to application.ini or bootstrap.php your intent is to cache the whole web site with all HTML page. You can use Zend_Cache in many different ways, though. You can use it to catch DB queries and much more. I have Zend_Cache setup in one action controller and can successfully catch the whole HTML page just for that particular action.</p>
