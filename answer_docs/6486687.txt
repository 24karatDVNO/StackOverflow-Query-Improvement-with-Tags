<ul>
<li>A property on the controller, just like the text is set</li>
<li>In a method, or the initializer</li>
<li>through a notification (NSNotificationCenter). This is a bit more advanced.</li>
<li>Through delegation, where the first controller is a datasource delegate on the Generated Controller. This allows the second controller to get what it needs, whenever it wants. </li>
</ul>

<p>Which method to use depends on how the controllers are created, when the image can change, and how many different pieces of data the second controller needs - one or two bits, properties work fine. More than that, I tend to use delegation. </p>
