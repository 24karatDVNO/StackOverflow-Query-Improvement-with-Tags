<p>I like your approach of evaluating columns instead of row-by-row, this seems to me that it would give you a performance boost.</p>

<p>To add to your idea, why not create a function to validate a specific column. For the columns with multiple correct values, you just put your check statement into a switch statement or something inside of that function.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>//Example function validates a field that contains an integer value
function validateField1($x)
{

   //if necessary you could parse apart the value before "switching" it.

   if(isset($x))
   {
      switch($x)
      {
         case 1: //integer 1 is a valid value
            return true;
         case 3: //integer 3 is a valid value
            return true;
         default://for all other values return false
            return false;
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This way you can evaluate the fields on a case by case basis.  In addition to that, if your validate function returns a false value you could programmatically edit the .csv file before uploading it to the database.</p>

<p>I have no idea if this will work for you, but do let us know how it turns out!</p>
