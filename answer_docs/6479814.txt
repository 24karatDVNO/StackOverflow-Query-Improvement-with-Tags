<p>Old thread that I came accross on Google. If anyone is looking, then I think I've got a neater solution:</p>

<pre><code>try
{
    //operation that throws the Exception
}
catch (EndpointNotFoundException e)
{
    WebException w = e.InnerException as WebException;

    if (w != null)
    {
         HttpWebResponse resp = w.Response as HttpWebResponse;
         if (resp != null &amp;&amp; resp.StatusCode == HttpStatusCode.NotFound)
         {
             //The error was a 404 not found
         }
         else
         {
             //The response was null, or the error was not a 404
         }
    }
    else
    {
        //The InnerException was not a WebException
    }
}
</code></pre>
