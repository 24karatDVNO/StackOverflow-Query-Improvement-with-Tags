<p>This answer is in Ruby:</p>

<pre><code># hash which opens appropriate file on first access
files = Hash.new { |surname| File.open("last_name-#{surname}.txt", "w") }

list.each do |first, last, age|
  files[last].puts [first, last, age].join(" ")
end

# closes all the file handles
files.values.each(&amp;:close)
</code></pre>
