<p>Thats imho not possible. You need at least a semantic relation between two words i.e tokens. IF you have something like a database including semantic synonym relations you can of course generate this data.</p>

<p>One example source would be wiktonary (XML Dump: <a href="http://de.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary%3aDownload" rel="nofollow">Link</a>). But there maybe other example dictionaries available but i think you will not get such a exhaustive source as you wish. Parsing the XML Dump of Wiktonary is maybe your best choice and you can even align synonyms across different languages if you happen to have a multi language index.</p>
