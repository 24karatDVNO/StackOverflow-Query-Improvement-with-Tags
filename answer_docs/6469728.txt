<p>You can use a tool like <a href="http://getfirebug.com/" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a>.  That will let you watch the actual HTTP requests, and step through the JavaScript.  In combination, that will let you see where the return value comes from.</p>

<p>Once you understand this, you can replicate the requests (and possibly parts of the JavaScript logic) in your Windows app using an appropriate HTTP client library.</p>
