<p>Figured out the problem in the end.</p>

<p>There was a page that was trying to loop through something when there wasn't anything to loop through.</p>

<p>Instead of giving me an ASP error it just broke the website and gave 504 errors.</p>

<p>Slightly misleading information but I got there in the end!</p>
