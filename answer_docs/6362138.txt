<p>checking your problem I think there is no support for that. The WPF's TabItem contains ItemTemplate &amp; ContentTemplate. The first is the template for the <strong>Header</strong>, the second is the template for the "body". In silverlight we still have no ContentTemplate. Haven't seen an official statement yet, but <a href="http://vortexwolf.wordpress.com/2011/04/09/silverlight-tabcontrol-with-data-binding/" rel="nofollow">this guy</a> says it won't be supported till SL5.</p>
