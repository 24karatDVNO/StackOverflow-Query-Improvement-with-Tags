<p>If I were you, I would leave the class as it is, but change the css, so it is the same css as the rest.</p>

<p>The other scenarios are: you change the plugin, but that would be bad, because if a newer version comes out, you'll have to change it again.</p>

<p>OR, you CAN unset the class. But then you would first let the plugin set it, and then you unset it, which is pretty dirty</p>

<p>You can easilly extend the existing css with some new css, so whenever and whatever changes in the future (your mind or the plugin :) ) it will be easy to controll.</p>
