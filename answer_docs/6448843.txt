<p>Running into the exact same set of issues.  To get rid of the first issue,the "unable to modify..." error, set your script tag to be deferred=deferred.</p>

<p>The second issue has to do with ie8's JavaScript parser from what I can find out.  There appears to be no answer, although I hadn't thought about an iframe, which if that would solve the issue, bonus!!!!</p>
