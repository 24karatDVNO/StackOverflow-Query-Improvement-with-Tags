<p>You can implement a basic locking system using the out-of-band messaging support built into db4o. Grant's list above can be implemented on the db4o server. Clients send a message to the server 'I want to edit object x' and the server tries to put the object in its list. If it succeeds, it'll reply with a 'Yes, go ahead' message, otherwise it can reply with 'No, try again later'. When the client is done editting, it'll send a message to the server saying 'I'm done with object x'.</p>
