<p>You have a controlled environment. You can create file on each emulator with generated UUID in it. And then read that UUID in your application and send that to server.</p>

<p>Also your application can check whether such UUID file exists, and if not create it. In this case no prior setup of emualtors is needed.</p>

<p>This should solve your issue without relying on ANDROID_ID and similar approaches. You can even extend this approach to real devices. </p>
