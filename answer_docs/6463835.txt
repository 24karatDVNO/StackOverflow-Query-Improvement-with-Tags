<p>If you're working in HTML5 then you can nest a block level element such as a <code>div</code> inside an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>

<p>If you're writing HTML4, then you could substitute an inline element such as a <code>span</code>. It is valid to nest a <code>span</code> inside an anchor in HTML4 or XHTML. To style the <code>span</code> as if it were a block level element, you could set its <code>display</code> property to <code>block</code>.</p>

<p>But as others have suggested already, unless you need the extra element, you can probably just style the anchor element directly. This avoids the necessity to add additional markup purely for stylistic purposes.</p>
