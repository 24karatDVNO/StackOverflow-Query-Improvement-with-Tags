<p>You can't do that. There is no way of comparing Strings in two VMs, with or without the == operator. Your question therefore isn't <em>about</em> anything. You would have to get them both into the same VM, whereupon you would call String.equals().</p>

<p>The == test is just a shorthand to avoid going through all the rest of the code. It is has nothing to do with Serialization whatsoever. And different VMs cannot possibly come into it.</p>
