<p>You can have a variable which type is a pointer to a funcion so when you call it, are you call the function or the function pointed by the variable with the same name? It is ambiguous. I think it's illegal. There is no problem for example in java, because there you can't have a variable that points to a function so the use of the parenthesis disambiguate if you are referring the function or the variable.</p>

<pre><code>typedef void (*functiontype)();
functiontype func;

void f1 () {
    ...
}
void func () {
    ...
}
void main() {
    func = &amp;f1;
    func();
}
</code></pre>
