<p>In this case, as Cocoanetics says, you’ll need to create a new developer certificate through the iOS Provisioning Portal, following the same procedure—using Keychain Access’s “request a certificate from a certificate authority” malarkey—that you used to create it originally. You’ll then have to recreate your development and distribution provisioning profiles using that new certificate.</p>

<p>To avoid this kind of problem in future, it’s a good idea to use Xcode’s “Export Developer Profile” feature: it creates a single encrypted package for you that contains the private key, certificates, and provisioning profiles that you have on your system. You can then easily back up that single file to a flash drive or online storage service or whatever, and re-import it later if you somehow lose your data again. To export the profile, go to the Organizer (Cmd-Ctrl-O in Xcode 3.x, Cmd-Shift-2 and then click on the “Devices” tab in Xcode 4) and select “Developer Profile” from the left-hand sidebar.</p>
