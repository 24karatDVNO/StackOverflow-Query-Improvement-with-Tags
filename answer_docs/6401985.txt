<p>There are two things you can do:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure the datatypes are the same on both sides of a comparison: ie compare with <code>10</code> (a number), not <code>'10'</code> (a char type) - it will make less work for the DB</li>
<li>In cases like this, I create a view, which means the calculation to be made just once, even if you refer to it more than once in the query</li>
</ul>

<p>If these two points are incorporated into you code, you get:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW geoNamesDistance AS
SELECT SQL_NO_CACHE DISTINCT 
       geonameid, 
       name, 
       (6367.41 * SQRT(2 * (1-Cos(RADIANS(latitude)) * Cos(0.704231626533) * (Sin(RADIANS(longitude))*Sin(-0.0669560660943) + Cos(RADIANS(longitude)) * Cos(-0.0669560660943)) - Sin(RADIANS(latitude)) * Sin(0.704231626533)))) AS Distance 
  FROM geoNames;

SELECT * FROM geoNamesDistance
WHERE Distance &lt;= 10
ORDER BY Distance;
</code></pre>
