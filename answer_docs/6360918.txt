<p>Well, you can just adjust the css for that image or the attributes. Use either height or width, just not both so they scale properly.</p>

<p>Jquery:</p>

<pre><code>$("img").css("width","150px");
</code></pre>

<p>I may be confused but don't all modern browsers support Ctrl + scroll to zoom?</p>
