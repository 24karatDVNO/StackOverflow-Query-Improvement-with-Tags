<p>I believe it is possible. However, you will need to save the comments on your own database while retrieving the wall posts from Facebook. This may be a little tough considering the fact that you'll need to map the comments on the database to the wall posts from Facebook.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how the plugin works - If it retrieves the Facebook data without storing it, then it may be a problem.</p>

<p>One possible work around maybe:</p>

<ol>
<li>Store the Facebook wall post in your database (Table1) and store the corresponding comments in Table2.</li>
<li>While displaying to users, pull the facebook and local comments from the database.</li>
</ol>

<p>One caveat is that the Facebook data will not be current.</p>
