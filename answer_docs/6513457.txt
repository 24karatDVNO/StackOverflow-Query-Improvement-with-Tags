<p>Rather than using a <code>has_many</code> association (which adds a bunch of setter methods, as well as getters), simply define a method (which you've more or less already done):</p>

<pre><code>def User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

   has_many :posts # written by the user

   # Posts the user can see
   def posts_visible_to
     if has_privileges?
        Post.all
     else
        posts
     end
   end

end
</code></pre>

<p>PS you spelled 'privileges' wrongly... :)</p>
