<p>You haven't provided enough information, but my guess is that the web server isn't responding the way you think it is -- did you peek the HTTP traffic with Fiddler or Firebug or look at what's in the file?</p>

<p>Can you get a copy of the image some other way -- if so, compare that to what you downloaded programmatically.</p>

<p>Finally, I am not sure what a JSP image is -- if img.jsp is a JavaServerPage that responds with an image, that doesn't make the image a JSP image -- it's still in the format that corresponds to its Content-type.</p>
