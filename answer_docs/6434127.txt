<p>It seems that line 57 is missing a closing brace directly before it.</p>

<p><code>while (PayCategory &lt; 1 || PayCategory &gt; 4)</code></p>

<p>After fixing this, you'll have to worry about the scoping of PayCategory.</p>

<p>Might I also recommend a friendly IDE with reformat capabilities?  IntelliJ does a great job at this (as does Eclipse and others).</p>
