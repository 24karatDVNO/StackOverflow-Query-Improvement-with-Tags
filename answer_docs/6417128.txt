<p>I suggest taking a look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.xml.xmlconvert.aspx" rel="nofollow">XMLConvert</a> class. You can use it to encode and Decode XML to make it safe.  This will also handle illegal characters as defined in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets" rel="nofollow">XML Spec.</a>  As pointed out already, removing text such as &amp;amp would actually change the underline data, therefore you should really encode and decoded as needed.</p>
