<p>The code you posted is 100% correct. I've done a fast simulation with what you provided and I got the response as expected. Only thing I could think of is that the div has "display:none".</p>

<p>As for the second problem try using </p>

<pre><code>die("Hello World");
</code></pre>

<p>instead of:</p>

<pre><code>echo "Hello World";
</code></pre>

<p>to see if the script follows desired execution path.</p>

<p>EDIT:
If I'm reading correctly you're trying to see echoed string in JS console? Not happening.</p>
