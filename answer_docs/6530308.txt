<pre><code>Caused by: groovy.lang.MissingPropertyException: No such property: Patient for class: hospitalmanagement.Physician
    at hospitalmanagement.Physician.&lt;init&gt;(Physician.groovy)
</code></pre>

<p>This is telling you that <code>hospitalmanagement.Physician</code> is trying to access a <code>Patient</code> property which doesn't exist (in the same class).</p>

<p>No idea how you should solve that since you haven't shown the corresponding code.</p>
