<p>Thanks for your help, but I found what the problem was.</p>

<p>I was rounding an image (probably should have specified this), and so the border rounding happened behind the image, i.e. the actual border was being rounded behind it, making it appear as though the border was thinner, or even transparent. By changing the image a little bit I managed to get the results I was looking for.</p>

<p>Thanks again everyone! N.S.</p>
