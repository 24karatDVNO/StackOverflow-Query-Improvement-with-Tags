<p>You might want to add a class="disableMe" or data-type="xyz" and do either a</p>

<p>jQuery(".disableMe").attr("disabled","disabled");</p>

<p>or </p>

<p>jQuery("[data-type='xyz'].attr("disabled","disabled");</p>

<p>Something like that should get you what you are looking for. I don't think the problem you are trying to solve has to do with Grails specifically.</p>
