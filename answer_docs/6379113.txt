<p>that's weird. I put label and button on a window, linked them, and put a menu item on the "View" menu on top, and linked it.
everything works fine.
Do you have a different setup? maybe a status bar menu?</p>

<p>Do you have your controller as an object on the left of the grid on the xib view? (I gues you do, since you linked everything, but still..)</p>

<p>maybe the menu item is linked somewhere else as well?</p>

<p>Menu items update automatically, so this should work fine.. just check the connections again.
I can send you the project I made to try it, although I doubt it will help..</p>
