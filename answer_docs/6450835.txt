<p>In release mode the ScriptManager will load the smaller, minified and unreadable JavaScript libraries. The debug version will load the actual source code with comments and good formatting but it will be slower because of the bigger size. Not that the ScriptManager will not automatically minify libraries that are not part of MS AJAX.</p>
