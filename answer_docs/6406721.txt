<p>Roland's answer is correct if you are downloading a dynamic binary. If it's something sitting around in your filesystem and you want Apache to set the correct headers try setting this in your <code>.htaccess</code>:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Files *.mp3&gt;
ForceType application/octet-stream
Header set Content-Disposition attachment
&lt;/Files&gt;
</code></pre>
