<p>It looks like the converter is just making a string representation of the displayables. If that's the case, I think what you really want to do is override the toString() method for each Displayable, and give each of them a constructor that takes a display string as an argument. Then you don't need to worry about implementing a separate Converter for each implementation of Displayable. So a Person would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Person implements Displayable {
    public Person(String display) {
        // Make a Person from a display
    }

    public String toString() {
        // Make a display from a person
    }

    ...
}
</code></pre>
