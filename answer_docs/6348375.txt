<p>There is nothing in the view for your products
Try adding  a line</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%: Html.EditorFor(model=&gt;mode.Products) %&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>which will render an editor for your products - but you probably want to tailor it by creating a Products.ascx in EditorTemplates</p>

<p>hope this helps.</p>
