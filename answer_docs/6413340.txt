<p>If you just want to hash things look into using an extension method, to generate the hash.</p>

<pre><code>public static int GenerateHash(this User myUser){
    return myUser.UserName.GetHashCode() ^ ... other properties....
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your code you could do:</p>

<pre><code>Console.WriteLine("Hash A: {0} | Hash B: {1}", a.GenerateHash(), b.GenerateHash());
</code></pre>

<p>This would leave everything intact, and should not break anything else.   If you are looking for a way to compare objects, you could do the same using an extension method:</p>

<pre><code>public static int AreEqual(this User myUser, User someOther){
    return myUser.UserName == someOther.UserName &amp;&amp; ...  other properties.
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usage would be like:</p>

<pre><code>if(a.AreEqual(b)){
    // these are equal have fun.
}
</code></pre>
