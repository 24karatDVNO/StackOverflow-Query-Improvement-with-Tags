<p>Have a look at a project called SaxDoMix <a href="http://www.devsphere.com/xml/saxdomix/" rel="nofollow">http://www.devsphere.com/xml/saxdomix/</a></p>

<p>It allows you to parse a large XML file, and have certain elements returned as parsed DOM entities. Much easier to work with than purs SAX parser.</p>
