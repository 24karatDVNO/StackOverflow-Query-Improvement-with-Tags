<p>Not without some extended hacking. It's definitely not something that Android wants you to be able to set. If I were dead set on trying, I would start by looking at <code>com.android.internal.telephony.PhoneFactory.getDefaultPhone();</code> and <code>com.android.internal.telephony.Phone.setVoiceMailNumber</code> and trying to invoke them through reflection. It's not something that I recommend bothering trying to do really.</p>
