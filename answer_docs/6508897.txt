<p>You would probably need to modify the onclick handler to find the element being clicked on (through it's ID most likely) and then call a function so that ID can be used in another function to determine what to show on te right side of the page).  Currently the accordian uses <em>this</em> which is a direct reference to the element, so you would want to consider passing that, or just the id from it.</p>

<pre><code>jQuery(document).ready(function(){
  myFunction = function(ele){
    //my custom show/hide stuff here
  };

  $('.accordion .head').click(function() {
    $(this).next().toggle();
    myFunction($(this));
    return false;
  }).next().hide();

});
</code></pre>
