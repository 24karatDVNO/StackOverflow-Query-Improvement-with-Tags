<p>The text is always defaulted to black so there no need to play with anything except setText.</p>

<p>There are a number of things you could be asking here so.</p>

<p>To set the text on load simply use setText at the top of your code.</p>

<pre><code>public TestFrame() {
    initComponents();
    jTextField1.setText("Hello I am text in a box");
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also have it respond to an event in the following way. Example is a button click.</p>

<pre><code>private void jButton1ActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {
//Text Box changes from default
   jTextField1.setText("The button was pushed!!");        
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that it is all the same, I feel like you are making it a little more complicated than it actually is. </p>
