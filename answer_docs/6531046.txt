<p>You should load your property file once in your application and defining it as <code>static</code> public constant that you can access directly in your constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {

   public static final PropertyFile pFile = ...

   public Foo() {
      super(pFile.getProperty("..."));
      ...
   }     

}
</code></pre>
