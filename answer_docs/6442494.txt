<p>You could create a small .net application to populate the table when needed. Here is an example in vb. It can be easily translated into c# by googling vb to C# converter. Just copy and paste the code into the converter.</p>

<pre><code>    Dim myConnection As SqlConnection
    Dim myCommand As SqlCommand
    Dim i as Integer 

    'Connect to database
    myConnection = New SqlConnection("server=localhost;uid=sa;pwd=;database=yourdb") 
    myConnection.Open()

    'Insert rows, you may be able to use a for loop to make inserting easier
    myCommand = New SqlCommand("INSERT INTO yourtable VALUES( 12, _
    'IT Manager')",100,300,myConnection)
    i=myCommand.ExecuteNonQuery()

    'Close the connection

    myConnection.Close()
</code></pre>
