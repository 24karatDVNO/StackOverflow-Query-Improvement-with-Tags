<p>You can do this in several ways. One way would be to include a check box, named <code>close_task</code> in your form. When this check box is checked and the form is submitted, you check for <code>param[:close_task]</code>.</p>

<p>So for example:</p>

<pre><code>def update
  if param[:close_task]
    @task.status = 'closed'
    @task.save
  end
  ...
end
</code></pre>
