<p>Looks like you're on Windows and don't have the curl extension enabled. Please read: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.extensions.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.extensions.php</a>. You need to find <code>php_curl.dll</code>, put it in your extension directory and load it from your php.ini</p>
