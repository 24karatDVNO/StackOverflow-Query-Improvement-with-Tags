<p>I didn't test this but it's something like...</p>

<pre><code>public struct SeasonEpisodeNr: IComparable
{ 
    public int seasonNr; 
    public int episodeNr;
    public int CompareTo(Object Item)
    {
        SeasonEpisodeNr that = (SeasonEpisodeNr) Item;

        if (this.seasonNr &gt; that.seasonNr)
            return -1;
         if (this.seasonNr &lt; that.seasonNr)
            return 1;

         if (this.episodeNr &gt; that.episodeNr)
             return -1;
         if (this.episodeNr &lt; that.episodeNr)
             return 1;

         return 0;
    }
