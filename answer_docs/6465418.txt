<p>If the elements in question are part of a substitution group in the schema, then you can write <code>self::schema-element(e)</code> where e is the head of the substitution group. This is a very useful technique where you have a large family of interchangeable elements. In XSD 1.1 an element can belong to more than one substitution group, so you can even introduce substitution groups specifically for this purpose.</p>
