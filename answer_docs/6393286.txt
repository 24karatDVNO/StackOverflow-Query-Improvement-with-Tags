<p>What you are probably observing is that when using smaller blocks, the second block of data can be read while the first is being processed, then the third read while the second is being processed, etc. so that the speed limit is the slower of the physical read time or the processing time.  If it takes the same amount of time to process one block as to read the next, the speed could be double what it would be if processing and reading were separate.  When using larger blocks, the amount of data that is read while the first block is being processed will be limited to amount smaller than the block size.  When the code is ready for the next block of data, part of it will have been read but some of it will not; it will thus be necessary for the code to wait while the remainder of the data is fetched.</p>
