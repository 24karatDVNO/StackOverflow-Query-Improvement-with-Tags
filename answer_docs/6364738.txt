<p>If you're trying to hide an existing form, <code>(new Form2()).Hide()</code> won't do it, since that will instantiate a new form from the class Form2.</p>

<p>Presuming Button1 is on the form you want to hide, you want:</p>

<pre><code>private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    (new Form3()).Show();
    this.Hide();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If it's not on the same form, you'll need a reference to the form you want to hide:</p>

<pre><code>private Form2 form2 = new Form2();
private Form3 form3 = new Form3();
form2.Show();

private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
   form2.Hide();
   form3.Show();
}
</code></pre>
