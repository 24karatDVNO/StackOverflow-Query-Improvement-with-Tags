<p>The SubVIs all appear to be in the llb file so they should be available. I'm not sure how you can access the subVIs directly from the llb file so you may want to convert this to a project folder (this is the new way of creating libraries since version 8 I think). There are some pages on the NI website that may help, try <a href="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361D-01/lvhowto/convert_llb_to_lib/" rel="nofollow">Converting an LLB to a Project Library</a> and then add this Project Library to your project.</p>

<p>From what I can see the VIs make use of the VISA drivers to communicate with the individual instruments so you should make sure you have this installed. You don't mention what version of LabVIEW 2010 you have but I think they should be provided even the Basic version, I know they are provided with the Professional Development System version.</p>
