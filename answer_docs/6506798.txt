<p>I had this problem earlier. All my applications that use a customized component based on Visualization API suddenly stop working, even older versions and local deployments.</p>

<p>Then I replace this line:</p>

<pre><code>VisualizationUtils.loadVisualizationApi(onLoadCallback, Blabla.PACKAGE);
</code></pre>

<p>with:</p>

<pre><code>VisualizationUtils.loadVisualizationApi(onLoadCallback);
</code></pre>

<p>and it works. Still have no idea on what has happened though.</p>
