<p>When using float,  a box is first laid out according to the normal flow, then taken out of the flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible.Whereas in position a box is removed from the normal flow entirely (it has no impact on later siblings) and assigned a position with respect to a containing block.So both has it own uses, and you can use them according to your need at the particular place. </p>
