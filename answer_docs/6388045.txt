<p>Python is full of these subtle glitches. For example you can do:</p>

<pre><code>first, second, last = (1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>And you can't do:</p>

<pre><code>first, *others = (1, 2, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>But in Python 3 you now can. </p>

<p>Your suggestion probably is going to be suggested in a PEP and integrated or rejected one day.</p>
