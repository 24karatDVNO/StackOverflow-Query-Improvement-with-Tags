<p>figured it out - just attach a boolean property on the mouse enter event and to make sure the mouse is still over the element providing the tool tip - on mouse enter set the mouse leave bool to false and the tool tip's IsOpen property to false. When the download has completed - bind your DataContext to the object with relevant data (or however you want to go about this) then, if mouse leave bool is still equal to false, set the IsOpen property = true</p>
