<p>To do the progress bar thing, you can use a queue. When something finishes downloading, update the progress bar, and start the next download. 
However, I don't think the WebClient class can tell you how much of the download finished, only if it is finished or not.</p>

<p>To verify if the directory exists, use:</p>

<pre><code>if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(folder_name)) System.IO.Directory.Create(folder_name);
</code></pre>

<p>You can get the directory from a path, using the System.IO.Path class.</p>
