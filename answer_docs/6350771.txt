<p>Use WPF (as mentioned) or use Gtk# (<a href="http://www.mono-project.com/GtkSharp" rel="nofollow">see website</a>)</p>

<p>Also, a wellknown trick with Winforms is to make ample use of datagrids bound to Datatables (or DataSets in general). Even if your backend isn't actually a ADO.Net provider you can dynamically create DataTables (adding columns with proper datatypes). The datagrid will know how to make these columns editable/sortable etc. </p>
