<pre><code>   expr1 expr2
      Two expressions in a row are taken to be joined with an  implied
      "and"; expr2 is not evaluated if expr1 is false.

   expr1 -a expr2
      Same as expr1 expr2.

<p>In the case of the path and the expression, I'm guessing it's just a parsing quirk that does nothing.</p>
