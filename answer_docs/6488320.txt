<p>Well, the simplest way I can think of is codeigniter. It will also help you with your contact form. Follow this <a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/codeigniter-from-scratch-day-4-newsletter-signup/" rel="nofollow">http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/news/codeigniter-from-scratch-day-4-newsletter-signup/</a> and check out some of the other tuts in the series. A simple mod rewrite will take care of the urls for you. Hope this helps.</p>
