<p>I had a similar problem and will list the steps that worked for me:</p>

<ol>
<li>Following <a href="http://www.christopherirish.com/2010/08/25/how-to-install-rvm-on-ubuntu-10-04/" rel="nofollow">this article</a> was very helpful (even if I have 11.04 installed)</li>
<li>The installation was performed with <code>sudo</code> privileges</li>
<li>The installation didn't added <code>/usr/local/rvm/bin</code> to <code>PATH</code></li>
</ol>

<p>Hope this helps to someone</p>
