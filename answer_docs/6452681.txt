<p>In your static main class instantiate a timer and create a elapsed event handler for the timer to go to when the 5 seconds are up. </p>

<p>in the elapsed event handler, call your method you want to run every 5 seconds. Keep in mind the timer and event handler span threads so you need to realize you could have two events happening at the same time - meaning code in a thead safe maner...</p>

<p>i just reread your post, you are using a timer... Keep in mind THREADSAFE. if you need to stop your timer before going into the method you need called when the elapsed even ocurs.</p>
