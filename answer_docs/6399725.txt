<p>Ok I got it right,
First thing first, never mix ManyToMany and choices, so my 2nd attempt was totally wrong. The problem was in form,</p>

<p>So Now final solution looks like,</p>

<pre><code>BUSINESS_GROUP = (
    ('MNC','Multinational'),
    ('INT','International (Export/Import)'),
    ('DOM','Domestic/National'),
    ('LOC','Local'),
    ('VIR','Virtual'),
)

class BusinessGroup(models.Model):
    bgroup_type = models.CharField(max_length=15)

class Business(models.Model):
    business_group_choices = models.ManyToManyField(BusinessGroup)
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than,</p>

<pre><code>class BusinessForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
    super(BusinessForm, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    self.fields['business_group_choices'].widget = forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple(choices=BUSINESS_GROUP)
</code></pre>

<p>In Form I have something like,</p>

<pre><code>class BusinessForm(forms.ModelForm):
   business_group_choices = forms.MultipleChoiceField(label="Business Group", widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple, choices=BUSINESS_GROUP)
</code></pre>

<p>You need to use MultipleChoiceField with CheckboxSelectMultiple.</p>

<p>This one in the model is totally wrong(mixing M2M and choices), </p>

<pre><code>class Business(models.Model):
    business_group_choices = models.ManyToManyField(BusinessGroup, verbose_name= "Business Group", choices=BUSINESS_GROUP)
</code></pre>
