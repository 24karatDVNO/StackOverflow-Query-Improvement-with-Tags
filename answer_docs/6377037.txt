<p>Along the lines of Mr E's answer, if you want to go the procedural route, look at various fractal algorithms.</p>

<p>Here's a map generator that uses erosion, I could imagine you layering several of those and maybe skewing things horizontally for your image: <a href="http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=5174.180" rel="nofollow">http://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=5174.180</a></p>

<p>There's all sorts of other pattern generators - simulating termites, forest fires, crystal growth, etc.</p>

<p>Here are some examples: <a href="http://neekatave.com/ca/examples/ffire/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://neekatave.com/ca/examples/ffire/index.php</a></p>

<p>You will see links in there to <a href="http://education.mit.edu/starlogo/" rel="nofollow">Star Logo</a>, which is an educational MIT project that has a bunch more examples (warning, you may lose a lot of time clicking around there :)</p>
