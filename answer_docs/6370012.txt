<p>Have you considered using pre-tested commits? If you run a remote run build (without committing in to VCS), you can be sure that you didn't break anything in VCS (just because you didn't commit yet). And you can continue working without problems. If the build is successful, you can commit your change (even if you made some other changes in the same files) - if you commit via TeamCity's plugin it will commit exactly the code you sent to the server for the testing.</p>

<p>This way, you don't have to wait until TeamCity's build has finished to continue working with it.</p>
