<p>If you have problems when moving from Mojarra to MyFaces, the best bet is send a mail to MyFaces users mailing list, so if there is a bug there are better chances to get it solved. Try the latest version (at JUN 2011 is 2.0.7 / 2.1.1). See <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/mail-lists.html" rel="nofollow">MyFaces Mailing Lists</a></p>

<p>The first one seems to be a bug, but more info related to your web.xml config is required. The second one is expected.</p>

<p>If it is a bug, you can file an issue here <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES" rel="nofollow">MyFaces Issue Tracker</a></p>
