<p>An alternative which works if one only wants to use a few library functions: Create a wrapper for everything that you use.</p>

<pre><code>// wrapper.cc
A* A_create() {
    return new A();
}

// and so on
</code></pre>

<p>This way you don't have to modify your library, but it's definitely some extra typing.</p>
