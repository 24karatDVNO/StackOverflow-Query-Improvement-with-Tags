<p>I think there should be an API which provides you the date when the apk is installed on the device, later we can compare that installation date to the current date and calculate if 5 days have occured or not. this may solve the problem. Sorry but I'm not aware of any such API's to get the installation date, but if the API is found then your problem can be solved. I just suggested a method of doing it. Let me also know if it has worked.</p>
