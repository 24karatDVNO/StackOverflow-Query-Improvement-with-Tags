<p>Dikei solved the mystory of the revision numbers -- let me answer your question about usernames. In a distributed system like Mercurial, a username such as "mg" would not be very useful and this is why it is normal to include the full name in changesets. Mercurial does not care, though, and you can put whatever you want there.</p>
