<p>If everything is fine (code, permissions in the manifest file), open two emulator windows (they will be something like <strong>5554:TestDevice1</strong> and <strong>5556:TestDevice1</strong>).</p>

<p>Now, if you are installing your application to 5554, send a message to 5556 and check in another emulator.</p>
