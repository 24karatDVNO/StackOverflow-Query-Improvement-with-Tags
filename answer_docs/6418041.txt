<p>You need to make sure your weights add up to 100.  An easy way to do what you're doing is to declare your widths as "0dp" and then use your weights to control the size of your layouts.</p>

<p>I described something similar in <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6417591/android-fixed-width-edittext-within-tablerow/6417672#6417672">this post</a></p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
