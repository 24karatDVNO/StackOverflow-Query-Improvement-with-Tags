<p>Yeah I'm going to have to agree here with Chris -- that's a lot of work with no simple solution. If you're looking for a single server and database to host your data, which can be accessed by a website, mobile application, etc, it <strong>can</strong> be done but carries a lot of <strong>work</strong> and connecting things together. To my knowledge there is nothing that sets things up for you.</p>

<p>I'd recommend looking into <strong>frameworks</strong> for your language (<strong>CakePHP</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, etc) to build up the database and web app, then create mobile apps that pull and interact with the data from XML files or some other source of relaying the data to your mobile device.</p>

<p>If I took your question in the right way, this is my recommendation on having a single database house your data which can be maintained and accessed through a website and mobile app. I've done this with a previous app and it worked fantastically on all ends. Good luck!</p>
