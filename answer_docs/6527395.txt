<p>This is probably rather inefficient, but could you take the same basic principal of the code you have posted and take the line of text the cursor is on, and loop through each individual character and do <code>[NSString sizeWithFont:forWidth:lineBreakMode:]</code> to calculate each character's width, and you could add all those up for your x position? Just an idea, but may help fix the issue with word wrapping.</p>
