<p>There are two approaches:</p>
<p><em><strong>1)  check the instantaneous state of the audio route</strong></em></p>

<p>This answer furnishes you with a ready-made method for detecting whether headphones are plugged in.</p>
<p><em><strong>2)  monitor route change events,  and set a flag whenever the route changes between headset and non-headset</strong></em></p>

<p>( would probably want to add the code from the first link into this to actually determine whether headset/non-headset status has been changed within the route change callback )</p>
