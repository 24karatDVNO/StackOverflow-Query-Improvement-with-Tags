<p>I believe that Report Builder V 1.0 was created to be ad-hoc friendly in that this feature was designed with the paradigm of a user not knowing what they are wanting to use at design time.  In other words, that the user had no other way of looking up entities.</p>

<p>With V 2.0, a different approach was taken obviously and it assumes the creator can query for that information and so the feature was dropped or just simply not brought over to 2.0.</p>

<p>F1 help on both versions demonstrates the "dropping" of this feature and looking around Microsoft MSDN seems to back up that assessment (eq feature notes are dropped in 2.0 documentation).</p>

<p>I could be wrong here but that is my understanding.</p>

<p>I hope that helps.</p>
