<p>What happens is that <code>*arrptr1++</code> is interpreted as <code>*(arrptr1++)</code>, which means that the pointer to the array is increased by one each time in the loop, and hence it will point to the same element as <code>array[i]</code>. <code>*arrptr + i</code> on the other hand is interpreted as "the <em>value</em> of the array element pointed to by <code>arrptr</code> plus the integer <code>i</code>". In this loop it means it will display the same thing as <code>array[i]</code>, but it is not pointing at the same element (<code>arrptr</code> is always pointing to the first element in your array). If you change the values in the array to something more random, it should be obvious when you run the program again.</p>
