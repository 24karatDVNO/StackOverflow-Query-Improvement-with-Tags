<p>The XLSX format consists of a number of XML files that have been zipped. If the format of the output will not be changing, it would be trivial to use an existing file as a template and simply add rows to it as necessary. Unfortunately <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/zipfile.html#zipfile.ZipFile.writestr" rel="nofollow"><code>ZipFile.writestr</code></a> doesn't allow you to write the file in pieces, so you'll have to write the entire XML to a temporary file then place that into the zip with <code>ZipFile.write</code>.</p>
