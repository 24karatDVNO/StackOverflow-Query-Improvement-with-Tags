<p>I managed to figure out a solution but not sure whether it is correct. When screen orientation changes, Android will invoke <code>onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()</code> method before <code>onDestroy</code> method. We can define a Boolean variable to act as a flag for screen orientation changed. This variable will set to true when <code>onRetainNonConfigurationInstance()</code> method is called.</p>
