<p>That's because you specify that the end point for your gradient is in middle of the currentBounds - see this line:</p>

<pre><code>CGPoint midCenter = CGPointMake(CGRectGetMidX(currentBounds), CGRectGetMidY(currentBounds));
</code></pre>

<p>To get rid of the black make sure the y coordinate is at the bottom of your view. </p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use this code to extend your gradient after the end point</p>

<pre><code> CGContextDrawLinearGradient(currentContext, glossGradient, topCenter, midCenter, kCGGradientDrawsAfterEndLocation);
</code></pre>
