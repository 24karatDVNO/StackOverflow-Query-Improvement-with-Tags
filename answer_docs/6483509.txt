<p>I don't think you can't do anything about the behavior in isolation.</p>

<p>One thing you can try is keep the page from zooming at all. This is good if your page is designed for the phone.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing you could try is using a JavaScript construct instead of the generic "select" statement. Create a hidden div to show your menu,  process the clicks in javascript.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
