  <p>I want to get the comments that either 1) current user has written, so something like: select * from comments where user_id = &lt;></p>

<p>That's correct. What's wrong with that?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get all comments that belong to a post that you have created. This is what I have, but I get multiple lines</p>
