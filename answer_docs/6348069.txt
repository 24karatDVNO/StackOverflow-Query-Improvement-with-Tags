<p>Consideration: Graph must be drawn on UI thread, so how responsive do you want the graph (real-time or delayed)?</p>

<p>Layout a graph (I do this on paper) to determine X and Y ranges, limitations, etc. This will help you get a clear vision of what you want.  </p>

<p>Putting this together without a way to test, but this might get you going in the right direction. I haven't ever created anything quite like a 'sparkline'.</p>

<pre><code>Point newPoint;
Point lastPoint;

void SetNewPoint( Point NewPoint );
{
    newPoint = NewPoint;
    myPicBox.Refresh ( ); // include the Rectangle area to refresh
}

void myPicBox_Paint ( object sender, PaintEventArgs e)
{
    // grab Graphics handle
    // paint line from lastPoint to newPoint

    // you will have to keep a collection of points if redrawing the entire graph
}
</code></pre>
