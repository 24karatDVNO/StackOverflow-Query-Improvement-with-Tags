<p>This will create a lot of unnecessary overhead if any of the classes aren't used. Each file will have to be parsed which will be unnecessarily time consuming. I agree with @Liangliang Zheng 100% in that you should use <code>__autoload</code>. As for the suggestion of @lbu and your original solution, it is recommended to not use the <strong>_once</strong> versions, they are more costly than just using <code>include</code> and <code>require</code>.</p>
