<p>This is what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard" rel="nofollow">vCard</a> was invented for. Create a vCard file (from Outlook or using a third party application), and host it online on some webspace. Or, if needed, you can create a webpage that generates the vCard dynamically. Simply add a hyperlink to the vCard URL to the email message body.</p>

<p>Upon clicking upon the URL, Outlook will open up the contents from the vCard as a new Outlook contact.</p>

<hr>

<p>That is, if Outlook isn't setup to block URLs, in which case you'd be better off sending the vCard as an attachment. Outlook signatures can be setup <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290840" rel="nofollow">to contain a vCard</a>.</p>
