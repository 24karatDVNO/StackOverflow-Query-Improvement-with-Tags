<p>Hmm, why do you need this? Instead, I would suggest thinking about what causes the element to be shown/hidden and react to that. It's always better to decouple your logic from view.</p>

<p>But if you still <strong>really</strong> want to do this, the only way I can think of right now is to have an interval that keeps polling for the element's visibility.</p>
