<p>DataContract and DataMember most definitely <em>are</em> available in all versions of WP7.</p>

<p>You do not need to specify int as the ancestor type because int is the default ancestor type.</p>

<pre><code>public enum videoType  
{
  LongVideo = 1,
  ShortVideo, 
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since you can convert int to an int-based enum with simple cast, I suggest casting as int to save and casting back to your enum to load.</p>
