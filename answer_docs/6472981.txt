<p>For kicks I would try using the full path to comspec: "C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe" or whatever path for the OS you are using in the off-chance it is resolving incorrectly.  </p>

<p>Also, can you toss in a /k to keep the cmd prompt open and see what, if any, errors show assuming it launches correctly?</p>
