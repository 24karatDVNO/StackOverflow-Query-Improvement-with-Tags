<p>In case anyone else still has problems with this, I am using Rails 3.0.9 and Devise 1.2.1 and was still having this problem. My problem was that IE won't set cookies for subdomains with an underscore in them. See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/794243/internet-explorer-ignores-cookies-on-some-domains-cannot-read-or-set-cookies">this answer</a> for the details. So I changed my subdomains to use dashes and it works now.</p>
