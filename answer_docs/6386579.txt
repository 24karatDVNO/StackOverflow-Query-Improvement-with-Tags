<p>Have you looked at <a href="http://drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations" rel="nofollow">Views Bulk Operations</a>? I'm not completely sure this will work, but I've done simliar things with nodes in D6:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a textfield to users (admin/config/people/accounts/fields), name it "Role".</li>
<li>In uif, is there a way to map your "role" column to a field? Then do it here!</li>
<li>Use VBO to select those with a specific "Role" field value, then add the real user role you want.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm not 100% sure that step 2 works, but I would definitely give it a try.</p>
