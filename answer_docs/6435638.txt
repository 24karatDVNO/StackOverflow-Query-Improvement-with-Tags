<p>Here is what I use</p>

<p>^ and $ match the positions at the beginning and end of the string, which mean search the entire string for the specific patter.</p>

<p>[A-Z] Means a range of characters between A to Z in Uppercase; means the 1st Character of the string must be in Capital letter.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
