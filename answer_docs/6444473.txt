<p>this can be done using a macro..</p>

<ol>
<li>create a temp sheet (with all the necessary columns (unique #, info1, info2, formuls)</li>
<li>do a countif('range of the uniqueid', 'current row unique id')</li>
<li>filter select anything that is more than 1 (on the field with the formula).</li>
<li>copy the selection onto a different workbook.</li>
</ol>

<p>voila.</p>

<p>if you aren't very well versed with VBA programming you can use the macro recorder to record the events &amp; modify it to suit your needs.</p>
