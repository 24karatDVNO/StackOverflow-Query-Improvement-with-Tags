<p>It would be easier to at least start by loading the data into a table with the surrogate ID:</p>

<pre><code>people father mother
------ ------ ------
john   tony   jane
tony   jack
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can add rows for the fathers and mothers not already in the "people" column:</p>

<pre><code>insert into mytable (people)
( select mother from mytable
  union
  select father from mytable 
)
minus
select people from mytable;
</code></pre>

<p>That will give you:</p>

<pre><code>people father mother
------ ------ ------
jack
tony   jack
jane
john   tony   jane
</code></pre>

<p>You can then add a surrogate ID for each row and use that instead, if you need it.</p>
