<p>You have an alternative to deal with this situation</p>

<ul>
<li>While setting up transaction replication on a table that has millions of records</li>
<li>Initial snapshot would take time for the records to be delivered to subscriber</li>
<li>In SQL 2005 we have an option to create the tables on both transaction and publish server, populate dataset and setup replication on top of it</li>
<li>When you add subscription with command EXEC sp_addsubscription set The @sync_type = 'replication support only'. </li>
