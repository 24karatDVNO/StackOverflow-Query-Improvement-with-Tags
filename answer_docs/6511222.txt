<p>I like to think I do know a thing or two about php and I am aware of the responsibility involved in this project. I am only working with a test gateway the creditcard company supplies, no actually monetary danger is involved. What baffles me really is that I can send standard html form post to this url and get a xml response but when I try doing this with javascript(with or without jquery) or with php I always get error code 500, exactly the same message I get when I change the url to <a href="http://some_crazy_url_that_doesnt_exist.com" rel="nofollow">http://some_crazy_url_that_doesnt_exist.com</a>, I've tried using the same php code on some other server url, it didn't give any response as the arguments supplied were all wrong but I didn't get error code 500 as with <a href="http://someurl.com/processPayment" rel="nofollow">http://someurl.com/processPayment</a>. The code I used is below if you are interested and want to point out some mistakes:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
function do_post_request($url, $data, $optional_headers = null)
{
  $params = array('http' =&gt; array(
              'method' =&gt; 'POST',
              'content' =&gt; $data
            ));
  if ($optional_headers !== null) {
    $params['http']['header'] = $optional_headers;
  }
  $ctx = stream_context_create($params);
  $fp = @fopen($url, 'rb', false, $ctx);
  if (!$fp) {
    throw new Exception("Problem with $url, $php_errormsg");
  }
  $response = @stream_get_contents($fp);
  if ($response === false) {
    throw new Exception("Problem reading data from $url, $php_errormsg");
  }
  return $response;
}
</code></pre>
