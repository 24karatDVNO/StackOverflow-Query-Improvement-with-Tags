<p>Unfortunately this isn't possible using VS menus (not with vsct, C#, etc), and they're not very extensible in this regard.  However, depending on what you're trying to do, (e.g. if you're looking to do this in a context menu within a tool window rather than the VS menu bar), you may be able to use WPF context menus which should give you the control you need.</p>
