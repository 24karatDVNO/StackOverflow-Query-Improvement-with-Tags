<p>I tried multiple fixes above, but only the one from KeenLearner worked for me.  I had to wrap ckeditor in a div tag (still inside the td cell in the table), and fix the width of div tag like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;td&gt;&lt;div style="width:642px;"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for the help, and I hope this helps someone else!</p>
