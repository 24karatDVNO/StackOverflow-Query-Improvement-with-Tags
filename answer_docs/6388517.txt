<p>It displays the text cursor because you are selecting Text while dragging (although you don't want to, but try just holding the mouse button, and moving it around the screen). To disable this, I would suggest you to use something like <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2310734/how-to-make-html-text-unselectable">this</a></p>

<p>You may need to change the code in the link to disable all text, not just text within tag label. To disable the text while dragging, and when you release the mouse button to undo the changes made by disabling the text.</p>

<p>As soon as the text selection is disabled, Chrome should have no reason to display other cursors.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am new to stackoverflow, and did not know a real tag would not be displayed.</p>
