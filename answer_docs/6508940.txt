<p>I think you should define a global boolean variable like this:</p>

<pre><code>var isAnimating = false;
</code></pre>

<p>and then control your animation based on that variable. ex:</p>

<pre><code>animateNews() {
    if (isAnimating) {
        //list animation
    }
}

listResume () { isanimating = true; }

listPause () { isanimating = false; }
</code></pre>

<p>and your animation would be like:</p>

<pre><code>window.onload = function () { var t = setTimeout("animateNews", 40); }
</code></pre>

<p>I wouldn't use jQuery for that one, since jQuery uses a little CPU also if you begin animating stuff... You would need it if you want to grow boxes smoothly or to slide images (gallery, or something like that).</p>
