<p>If You want to encrypt data I would go with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/as3crypto/" rel="nofollow">ASCrypt3o</a> library.<BR/>
It works very well and supports multiple types of encryption.<br/>
You can see a demo of it <a href="http://crypto.hurlant.com/demo/" rel="nofollow">here</a> click on the secret key tab.</p>
