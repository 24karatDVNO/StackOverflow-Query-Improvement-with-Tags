<p>The only way that would <em>not</em> get called is if there was an exception or some other behavior that caused it not to progress to the next statement (ie, catastrophic failure).</p>

<p>You can guard against an exception preventing it from happening by putting it in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ke0zf0f5%28v=vs.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">a <code>finally</code> block</a>:</p>

<pre><code>public void Process()
{
    try {
        Order o = new Order();
        // Do stuff
    } finally { 
        o.Complete(GetTransactionId());
    }
}
</code></pre>
