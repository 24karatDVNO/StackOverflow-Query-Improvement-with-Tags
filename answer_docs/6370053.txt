<p>From my answer to another Raphael/IE related problem:</p>

<p>Have you tried using <a href="https://github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/tree/2.0" rel="nofollow">Raphael 2.0</a>? I think it's still in beta stage, but I found that it's got improved VML capabilities.</p>

<p>Also be sure to test browser behavior with an uncompressed version of Raphael, as minified versions seem to have bugs. Instead, I've used <a href="http://dean.edwards.name/packer/" rel="nofollow">Packer by Dean Edwards</a>, which gave me a compressed and bug free version of the lib.</p>
