<p>Resolved it myself, but not through using mail labels. In fact I couldn't get it to work with mail labels.</p>

<p>I moved the Group header/footer to the Page header/footer, and then suppressed both (empty) group header and footer. The group footer I set to "New page after". Ticked "Format Groups with multiple column", and adjusted the section heights and data heights to fit on one page.</p>
