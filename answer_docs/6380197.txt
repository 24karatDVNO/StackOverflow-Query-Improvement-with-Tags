<p>There is a .gemspec file in the most recent version of the shopify repository, if you pull it into yours, then your gem line needs to look like the following:</p>

<pre><code>gem 'activemerchant', :git =&gt; 'https://github.com/rayvinly/active_merchant.git'
</code></pre>

<p>Note no underscore in the gem name.</p>
