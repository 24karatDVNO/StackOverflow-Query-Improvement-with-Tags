<p><code>int</code> is value type, meaning its value is copied each time you use it and not its reference. The best way to make this work is make reference type around int:</p>

<pre><code>class IntRef
{
    public int Val;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You will need to always use <code>IntRef.Val</code> and passing the <code>IntVal</code> itself around will retain the reference.</p>
