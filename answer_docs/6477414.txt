<p><strong>officially</strong><p>i have never seen commandline programs on android, whether written in java or android ndk.<p><strong>unofficially</strong><br><br>i have seen commandline c/c++ programs targeting arm processors and the authors claimed they run on android eg <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/dffafba924e3a2e6/185fa4fdcc99bd8e" rel="nofollow">follow this link to whet your appetite</a>
<p><strong>My thoughts</strong>?<br>Should you write such 'unofficial' applications, i doubt that you will be able to distribute them to your customers eg through the <strong>android market</strong> since android applications are dalvik executables(kind of java applications compiled and optimised for the dalvik virtual machine)</p>
