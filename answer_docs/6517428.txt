<p>Firstly, this is <strong>a</strong> solution but not necessarily the <strong>best</strong> solution, since it really depends on your needs. We have a fixed size file text file that is used as a circular log. We have the benefit of fixed-length log messages so this works for us. Once a day, at a quieter time, a server extracts the log entries it has yet to read. It can handle a couple of hundred entries per second without breaking a sweat. There is a risk that older entries will get overwritten by newer if the server hasn't extracted enough in time, but the size of the file is such that this is unlikely to happen since we also have the benefit of knowing in advance roughly what the maximum number of entries per day will be.</p>

<p>But as I say, it depends on your needs to a large degree as to which solution is best. I haven't used C# event logs but if they're anything like the old Windows NT event loggers, it has the benefit of being able to be read externally without the client program doing anything.</p>
