<p>.html() in jQuery is an equivalent of innerHTML(), which means that in normal browsers (e.g FF, Chrome) it should get it right, while in IE you'll have to use the outerHTML property.</p>

<p>I'd try using the outerHTML jQuery plugin to get the element entirely: <a href="http://yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/" rel="nofollow">http://yelotofu.com/2008/08/jquery-outerhtml/</a></p>

<p>Hope it helps :)</p>
