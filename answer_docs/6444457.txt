<p>I had a similar issue; based on the data i had two types of normal states and after mouse-out, i wanted the renderer to identify which of the two states to revert to. I used the "override function" solution given in the above link to achieve the desired effect.</p>

<p>My Solution:</p>

<pre><code>            override protected function itemRenderer_rollOutHandler(event:MouseEvent):void {
                if (data.index == 0) {
                    this.currentState = "keyNormal";
                }
                else {
                    this.currentState = "normal";
                }
            }
</code></pre>

<p>I just entered the above code in the  block in my custom ItemRenderer.</p>
