<p>There are certain situations where you might want a view model: to combine data from multiple models/sources, or for specific validation scenarios, etc., but, it's perfectly acceptable to have your view take a model without an intermediary view model, especially if the view model is just a class of getters and setters with no other functionality.</p>

<p>If you're not concerned about exposing methods/properties from your domain model (or if it doesn't apply), I would just pass the model straight to the controller.</p>
