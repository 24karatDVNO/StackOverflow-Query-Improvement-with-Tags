<p>I checked out the code and it looks like it loads fine with Rails 2 or Rails 3 with Ruby 1.8.7 and 1.9.2, but is only having issues with Sinatra under Ruby 1.8.7 (loads fine with 1.9.2).</p>

<p>I'm still not sure why the discrepancy, but I'll keep looking into it when I get a chance.  The fact that it works in most of the environments above seems to tell me the $:.push line isn't really causing any problems (but it may not be necessary since you're using git to package your gem files already in the .gemspec).</p>
