<p>You don't have to use the checkboxes; just go by url and replace the parameters:
<a href="http://countrysize.com/?cou1=pk&amp;cou2=es" rel="nofollow">http://countrysize.com/?cou1=pk&amp;cou2=es</a></p>

<p>in this example it's pk = pakistan and es = el salvador</p>

<p>Google can find the complete list of all valid country codes for you. Now you just have to take the screenshots.</p>
