<p><code>wait()</code> does indeed return the PID of the child process that died. If you only have one child process, you don't really need to check the PID (do check that it's not zero or negative though; there are some conditions that may cause the wait call to fail). You can find an example here: <a href="http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411/www/NOTES/process/fork/wait.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.csl.mtu.edu/cs4411/www/NOTES/process/fork/wait.html</a></p>
