<p>For example, you can make a boolean variable to mark, if there is an error, and exit if it's true + combine error messages into one</p>

<pre><code>$error = false;
if(empty($_POST['studentName'])) 
{
$errorMessages[] = "You did not enter the student name Wank";
$error = true;
}
//Code to check that the Tutor Name field is completed
if(empty($_POST['tutorName'] ))
{
$errorMessages[] = "You did not select a tutor name. Please go back and select your name from the tutors list";
$error = true;
}
//Code to check that the Procedure field is completed
if(empty($_POST['procedure'] ))
{
$errorMessages[] = "You did not select a procedure. Please go back and enter the name of the      procedure which you undertook";
$error = true;
}
//Code to check that the Grade field is completed
if(empty($_POST['grade'] ))
{
$errorMessages[] ="You did not select a grade. Please go back and select your grade from the drop down list";
$error = true;
}
//Code to check that the Student Reflection field is completed
if(empty($_POST['studentReflection'] ))
{
$errorMessages[] = "The student did not enter any comments for this procedure. Student reflection is required for each procedure. Please go back and enter any comments";
$error = true;
}
//Code to check if the tick box is checked that the tutor comment is entered

if( !strlen($_POST['tutorComments']) &amp;&amp; isset($_POST['alert'] ))
{
    $errorMessages[] = "You must enter a reason why you have clicked the alert box";
    $error = true;
}
if($error)
{
    echo("&lt;h3&gt;".implode('&lt;br/&gt;',$errorMessages)."&lt;/h3&gt;");
    exit();
}
</code></pre>
