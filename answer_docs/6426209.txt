<p>You need to determine when a thread was finished:</p>

<pre><code>// Create and start a thread
Thread thread = new MyThread();
thread.start();

// Check if the thread has finished in a non-blocking way
if (thread.isAlive()) {
  // Thread has not finished
} else {
  // Finished
}

// Wait for the thread to finish but don't wait longer than a
// specified time
long delayMillis = 5000; // 5 seconds
try {
   thread.join(delayMillis);

  if (thread.isAlive()) {
     // Timeout occurred; thread has not finished
  } else {
     // Finished
  }
 } catch (InterruptedException e) {
    // Thread was interrupted
}

// Wait indefinitely for the thread to finish
try {
 thread.join();
  // Finished
} catch (InterruptedException e) {
  // Thread was interrupted
}
</code></pre>
