<p>After many days trying, googling, searching, still couldn't find a good <em>working</em> package for both Js &amp; Php to compress form data, submit &amp; decompress.</p>

<p>I came up another solutions to save <em>a lot</em> of bandwidth for Updating speed. I intended to update delta diff of submitted text, but then it's too hard for me, so I just write some code to detect which lines user is changing &amp; submit just those lines.</p>

<p>Please still answer this question if you find out another better one. Thanks.</p>
