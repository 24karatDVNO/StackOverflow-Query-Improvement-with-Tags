<p>I had a heck of a job trying to get PDO driver's working - it turned out i just needed to reboot my system.</p>

<p>..this shouldn't have been necessary but it did work. So if you are sure you have taken all the steps necessary to enable the drivers and it's still not working, give the reboot a shot.</p>
