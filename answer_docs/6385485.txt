<p>If I get this right this should link a username to an EJB across more than one methodcall, which in my opinion is a state. I guess the standard for this would be to create a Stateful SessionBean with a <code>setUser(String name)</code> method. In a stateless bean you would have to pass the userName (or properties object) on each methodcall.</p>
