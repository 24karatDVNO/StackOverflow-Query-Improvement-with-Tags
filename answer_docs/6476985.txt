<p>I would suspect that in the second case JSON is being returned you will need to do:</p>

<pre><code>$.ajax({ url: link + "?" + Math.random(), success: function (response) {
            $(response).each(function() {
/*do something with data, firefox with firebug allows you to do console.log($this) which will show you the data in a window below the browser, Chrome also has a similar feature, alerting in an iterator is never a good idea.*/
})
}});
</code></pre>
