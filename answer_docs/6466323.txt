<p>So your problem is that you are trying to use a VPN (hamachi) to connect two apps the server and the client so that the client can receive messages from the server right? I think that the error given "The requested address is not valid in its context" is because you are using a VPN but I don't know how this can be solved sorry. What I think is that maybe you might also need the network id and password but again I'm not sure. Please keep us informed because this is a very interesting question.</p>
