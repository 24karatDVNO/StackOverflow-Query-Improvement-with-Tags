<p>Depending on your application needs, your data structure should have some time of Parent-Child relationship. All you should have to do is remove the <code>Child</code> that is selected from the parent, and the <code>TreeView</code> in <code>WPF</code> should just automatically update.</p>

<p>I suggest you read <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/WPF/TreeViewWithViewModel.aspx" rel="nofollow">Josh Smith's article on using <code>ViewModels</code> with the <code>TreeView</code></a> for easier management. Trust me it will make your life a lot easier the sooner you start using a stronger data structure, and just remember that a <code>TreeView</code> only represents the data provided, and you should have other methods to edit the data directly and not the <code>TreeView</code>.</p>
