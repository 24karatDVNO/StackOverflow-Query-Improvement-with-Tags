<p>For security reasons <strong>Web pages have no access to users hardware</strong> through normal processes.</p>

<p>You can create and ask the user to install an ActiveX object (IE only) or use a Java Applet (all browsers).</p>

<p><strong>FogBugz</strong> is a Online Bug Report and they offer a way of doing a screndump directly to a Bug Id, but you still need to install the client application to do just that.</p>

<p>You can also use Silverlight as that requests user permission to access some of the hardware, like Audio, Screen, Printers, etc...</p>
