<p>I solved this by adding</p>

<pre><code>[self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:YES];
[self.navigationController setNavigationBarHidden:NO animated:YES];
</code></pre>

<p>at the start of viewDidLoad. This caused it to somehow reset and move the view. I can't really see an animation going on though. I think the root of the problem might lie in the fact that I'm switching from portrait mode to landscape mode and that somehow messes with the bar.</p>
