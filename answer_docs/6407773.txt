<p>The code in your example, although it's probably describing something, doesn't do anything productive in my eyes :). Since before the while loop <strong>root</strong> and <strong>conductor</strong> are pointing at the same thing and the <strong>next</strong> of that object contains <strong>0</strong>. So the while loop will never fire. After that we create a new node and let <strong>next</strong> point to it. Then we instead point <strong>conductor</strong> to the node and set it's <strong>next</strong> to <strong>0</strong>. This would result in a memory leak.</p>
