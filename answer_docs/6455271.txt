<p>You would need to use HAVING clause instead of WHERE clause.</p>

<p>The SQL HAVING clause is used in conjunction with the SELECT clause to specify a search condition for a group or aggregate. The HAVING clause behaves like the WHERE clause, but is applicable to groups - the rows in the result set representing groups. In contrast the WHERE clause is applied to individual rows, not to groups.</p>

<p>Hope this helps.</p>
