<p>You should use <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreMotion/Reference/CMMotionManager_Class/Reference/Reference.html" rel="nofollow">CMMotionManager</a> on iOS 4+, it's heavily tuned by Apple for performance and accuracy. Use it in poll mode (calling -deviceMotion periodically) in your game loop, it'll be much more performant than async notifications and just as accurate.</p>
