<p>I found the issue finally. ObjectContainerFactoryBean is relying on OSGiResourceBundle to load the resource as a file object. Though OSGiResourceBundle exposes a method called getFile(), it doesn't work as intended in an OSGi environment. It always expects a file protocol whereas the resource returned as an URI has a protocol "bundle".Hence, the exception is being thrown. The workaround is to use a inputstream or getUrl. Since I didn't have the source code of ObjectContainerFactoryBean, I had to extend this class to provide my own implementation which loads the file as an inputstream.</p>
