<blockquote>
  <p>Version 3.5 of the .NET Framework was
  released on 19 November 2007, but it
  is not included with Windows Server
  2008. As with .NET Framework 3.0, version 3.5 uses the CLR of version
  2.0. In addition, it installs .NET Framework 2.0 SP1, (installs .NET
  Framework 2.0 SP2 with 3.5 SP1) and
  .NET Framework 3.0 SP1 (installs .NET
  Framework 3.0 SP2 with 3.5 SP1), which
  adds some methods and properties to
  the BCL classes in version 2.0 which
  are required for version 3.5 features
  such as Language Integrated Query
  (LINQ). These changes do not affect
  applications written for version 2.0,
  however.</p>
