<p>PEAR logging class is pretty nice and simple. 
There is no need to configure things via xml and there are no other dependencies.
You can download and simply drop in pear package <a href="http://pear.php.net/package/Log/download" rel="nofollow">PEAR log</a> (no need to install it via PEAR or Pyrus).</p>
