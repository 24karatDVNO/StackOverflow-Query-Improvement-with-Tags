<p>Change you WHERE Condition from this: </p>

<pre><code>Where Condition: [ID] = [Customer ID]
</code></pre>

<p>To this:</p>

<pre><code>"[ID]=" &amp; Me![Customer ID] 
</code></pre>

<p>You have to tell it where to pull the Customer ID from. By using, the <code>Me</code> you are letting it know it is from that form. </p>
