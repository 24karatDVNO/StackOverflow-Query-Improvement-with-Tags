<p>Looking at the python implementation for OS9 os.path.join (macpath)</p>

<pre><code>def join(s, *p):
  path = s
  for t in p:
    if (not s) or isabs(t):
        path = t
        continue
    if t[:1] == ':':
        t = t[1:]
    if ':' not in path:
        path = ':' + path
    if path[-1:] != ':':
        path = path + ':'
    path = path + t
  return path
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not familiar with developing under SDL on older Macs. Another alternative in game resources is to use a package file format, and load the resources into memory directly (such as a map &lt; string, SDL_Surface > )</p>

<p>Thereby you would load one file (perhaps even a zip, unzipped at load time)</p>
