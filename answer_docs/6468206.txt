<p>You can find the pid, and checks that you're really its parent by doing:</p>

<pre><code>// Find child processes according to current pid
$res = trim(exec('ps -eo pid,ppid |grep "'.getmypid().'" |head -n2 |tail -n1'));
if (preg_match('~^(\d+)\s+(\d+)$~', $res, $pid) !== 0 &amp;&amp; (int) $pid[2] === getmypid())
{
    // I'm the parent PID, just send a KILL
    posix_kill((int) $pid[1], 9);
}
</code></pre>

<p>It's working quite well on a fast-cgi PHP server.</p>
