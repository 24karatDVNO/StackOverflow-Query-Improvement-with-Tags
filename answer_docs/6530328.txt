<p>It seems like what you actually want may be a dictionary, not a list. </p>

<pre><code>something = {}
for u in range(3):
    something[u] = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>With a list, the list has to already have at least u elements before you can assign list[u], but with a dictionary you can add new items arbitrarily.</p>
