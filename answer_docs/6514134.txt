<p>Since jazzy is open source, it was forked and included with RText, which is another open source project.  I happened to have a need for RText (which builds with Ant) for use in another open source maven project (SQuirrel SQL Client), so I applied to Sonatype for permission to use the net.sf.jazzy groupId.  Since the release that comes with RText has bug-fixes and other mods, we chose to use a "special" versionId (0.5.2-rtext-1.4.1) that would (hopefully) indicate that this version was not an "official" jazzy release of version 0.5.2, but rather one that was shipped with RText version 1.4.1.  Unfortunately, I omitted the resources (config and translation property files) when I prepared the initial release.  I have corrected that by issuing another release which is available here: <a href="http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/sf/jazzy/jazzy/0.5.2-rtext-1.4.1-2/" rel="nofollow">http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/net/sf/jazzy/jazzy/0.5.2-rtext-1.4.1-2/</a>.</p>
