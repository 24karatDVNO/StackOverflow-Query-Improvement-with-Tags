<p>I would install it on the main domain name.  It sounds better to put it on a sub domain but then you technically have a whole separate website to maintain and this could be a negative rating for search engines.  Also, need another SSL certificate if you want anything secure on your main site.</p>

<p>Depending on your back end technology (i.e. - .NET, ASP, PHP), it only takes a couple lines of code to check the page request and redirect the user to the proper page desired.  For example, if a user goes to [http://www.domain.com/secure] you can redirect the request to the proper secure page (https://www.domain.com/secure) and vice versa. </p>

<p>.htaccess is an older technology and can be very cumbersome to use.</p>
