<p>I would suggest building it yourself (Adam details how to do so). This will give you fine control on where to install and all the options you want to select. My experience from having multiple versions of gcc is that, if care is not taken apple's version of gcc can be damaged. </p>

<p>To speed up gcc installation you might want to look at --enable-languages option. If there are languages you don't need installed with the new gcc then you may not want to select them. </p>
