<p>If you look at the intellisence it shows that <code>.SelectedValue</code> returns a string.
The <code>.GetSelectedIndices()</code> is the only member that returns all selected values from what I can see, But because it is a method and not a property not sure how your suppose to bind to it.</p>

<p>From what I can tell this is a limitation of the listbox. To get the functionality your looking for you'll need to write some codebehind, and/or javascript to pull out the values for your query.</p>
