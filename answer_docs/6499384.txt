<p>Your best bet is probably to handle the Camera class directly, and then store the jpeg or raw returned in the callback where you want.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could try and delete the taken image by _id from the content provider for media after it's been added. Just find it by query and delete it via the ContentResolver.delete, not sure about the implementation though.</p>
