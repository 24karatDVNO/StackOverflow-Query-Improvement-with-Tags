<p>Google won't submit the form to index your site. </p>

<p>However, since all you want is to preserve that look, why not just have a link to the rest of your site in your footer or navigation? You could even submit a sitemap to Google. Or just submit the URL  : <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?continue=/addurl</a></p>
