<p>This pretty much summarizes your needs(via lifehacker.com)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you're FTP'ing across your home
  network (like from your upstairs PC to
  your bedroom PC), you can reach the
  server by using its internal network
  address (most likely something like
  192.168.xx.xx.) From the command line, type ipconfig to see what that address
  is. If you want to log into your FTP
  server over the internet, set up a
  memorable URL for it and allow
  connections from outside your network.
  To do so, check out how to assign a
  domain name to your home server and
  how to access your home server behind
  a router and firewall.</p>
