<p>This will depend on the font, DPI and other settings. I recommend looking up <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb760767%28v=VS.85%29.aspx#text_static_control" rel="nofollow noreferrer">static text controls</a> which says:</p>

<p>Combined with this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4761594/how-to-measure-static-size-beforehand-winapi">post</a> about calculating the size of the resulting text should get you on your way to calculating the text width (and with knowledge of the text height the number of lines).</p>
