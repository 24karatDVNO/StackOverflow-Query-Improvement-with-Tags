<p>i found a way to send json through javascript, el, in a jsf page,
first i enconde the the arraylist of objects with the flexjson library in java.</p>

<p>2) the this object i put it in a java bean
3) the i call the javascript with the oncomplete event
4) like this callapp(#{bean.jsonString})
5) this is received in flex with the external interface
ExternalInterface.addCallback</p>

<p><a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7e92.html" rel="nofollow">http://help.adobe.com/en_US/flex/using/WS2db454920e96a9e51e63e3d11c0bf69084-7e92.html</a></p>

<p>6) then something weird occurs, the json string is converted in a array of objects of ACTIONSCRIPT
so i just have to loop through the array, and obtain the objects properties and buala â€¦</p>
