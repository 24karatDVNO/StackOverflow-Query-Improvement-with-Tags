<p>Normally this would be done with the Event structure of ActionScript (this is an incredibly simple example):</p>

<pre><code>// in OauthConnection.init as the last line
dispatchEvent( new Event( "eventName" ) );

//around your example aboe.
oauthConnection.addEventListener( "eventName", eventHandler );
busyOn();
init();

// later in the class.
function eventHandler( evt:Event ):void
{
    busyOff();
}
</code></pre>
