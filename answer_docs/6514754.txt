<p>The asterisk <code>*</code> is more general than the hat <code>^</code>. As a type modifier, <code>T*</code> means C++-pointer, and <code>T^</code> means CLI-reference. However, the other use of the symbol for the <strong>dereference operator</strong> applies to both types, and the indirect-call operator <code>-&gt;</code> does likewise:</p>

<pre><code>T * x = new T;
T ^ y = gcnew T;

*x = 5;
*y = 6;

x-&gt;foo();
y-&gt;foo();
</code></pre>

<p>The idea is that dereferencing is a general concept that's independent of the particular type of reference, so the same symbol can be used to minimize syntax proliferation.</p>
