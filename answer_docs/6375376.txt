<p>The special characters in reference SGML (hence HTML) are (as far as you need to know) <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&amp;</code>. If you start with real-world text that you want to include in your mark-up, you have to replace precisely all of those by their entity or character references (<code>&amp;lt;</code> etc.) and you will be fine. (Exceptions are if you are inside an CDATA marked section or an element with content type CDATA, but let us just assume that that's never the case.)</p>
