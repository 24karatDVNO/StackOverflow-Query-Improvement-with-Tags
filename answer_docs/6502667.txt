<p>From Wikipedia:
Traditionally, XML APIs are either:</p>

<pre><code>tree based - the entire document is read into memory as a tree structure for random 
access by the calling application
event based - the application registers to receive events as entities are encountered 
within the source document.

StAX was designed as a median between these two opposites. In the StAX metaphor,
the  programmatic  entry point is a cursor that represents a point within the 
document. The application moves the cursor forward - 'pulling' the information from 
the parser as it needs. This is different from an event based API - such as SAX - 
which 'pushes' data to the application - requiring the application to maintain state 
between events as necessary to keep track of location within the document.
</code></pre>

<p>So for 100M and more - I preffer SAX - if it possible use instead StAX.</p>

<p>But I tryed your code with file size 2,6GB on JVM64. Without problem. So I suppose that problem not for size of file but for may be for data.</p>
