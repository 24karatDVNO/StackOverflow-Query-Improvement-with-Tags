<p>Silverlight doesn't support multiple app domains, so if you load dll (silverlight app is nothing more than dll) into your sliverlight app it will have same access rights as your own code. That includes access to the isolated storage, also if your app have elevated permissions then loaded dll will have elevated permission as well. You should consider very carefully the repercussions of loading untrusted 3rd party dlls into your app as it could result in the serious security breach. </p>
