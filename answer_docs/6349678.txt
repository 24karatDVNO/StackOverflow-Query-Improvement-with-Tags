<p>I had a simiar question a while ago <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6017164/save-load-2-xdocuments-to-from-one-stream">here</a> about saving 2 XML files in one file.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6017164/save-load-2-xdocuments-to-from-one-stream/6028948#6028948">answer</a> with code.</p>

<p><em>"I ended up writing my own Stream, which can be thought of as a multistream. It allows you to treat one stream as multiple streams in succession. i.e. pass a multistream to an xml parser (or anything else) and it'll read up to a marker, which says 'this is the end of the stream'. If you then pass that same stream to another xml parser, it'll read from that marker, to the next one or EOF"</em></p>

<p>Your basic usage would be:</p>

<pre><code>Writing:
    Open File Stream
    Create MultiStream passing in File Stream in constructor
    Write data file to multistream
    Call write end of stream marker on multistream
    Write 2nd data file to multistream
    Call write end of stream marker on multistream
    Save picture to multistream
    Close multistream
    Close file stream

Reading:
    Open File Stream
    Create MultiStream passing in File Stream in constructor
    Read data file
    Call advance to next stream on multistream
    Read 2nd data file
    Call advance to next stream on multistream
    Read image (Image.FromStream() etc.)
    Close multistream
    Close file stream
</code></pre>
