<p>The approach I use in my company is to store the addin files (and any other dependant files) in an svn repository.  Users check out the relavent folder to their machine to a consistent location (can be a bit like herding cats to get everyone to use the same folder structure).<br>
When an update is available simply advise users to update their svn checkout folder.</p>
