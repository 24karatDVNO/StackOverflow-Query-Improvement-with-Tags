<p>why not use a left join and use <code>fieldX=3</code> as a join condition? if fieldX is different from 3, sql fills the field with <code>NULL</code></p>

<pre><code>select a.field1, a.field2, sub.value
from abc a
left join
(
  select value from sub_table
  where cat_id = 3
  limit 0,1
) sub
on a.fieldX = 3
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you do want to get all rows for the corresponding values (i see you have <code>cat_id = 3</code> and <code>fieldX = 3</code>, so basically <code>cat_id = fieldX</code>), just use a simple join. no need to use complicated if constructs. sql was built to do fast and efficient joins:</p>

<pre><code>select a.field1, a.field2, sub.value
from abc a
left join sub_table sub
on a.fieldX = sub.cat_id
</code></pre>

<p>note however, that the second query will return multiple rows, when there are more matches between fieldX and cat_id (non-unique <code>cat_id</code>)</p>
