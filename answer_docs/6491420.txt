<p>You can make a hidden field in your form, for example</p>

<pre><code>&lt;input type="hidden" name="isSubmitted" value ="1"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in your checking routines, you first check if $_POST['isSubmitted'] (or $_GET['isSubmitted']) == 1 If it's true, then you know that user have been submitted your form, and you can make your additional checks</p>
