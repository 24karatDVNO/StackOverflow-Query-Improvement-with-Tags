<p>You will need JavaScript if you want to avoid reloading the page. You can use <code>link_to</code> for links in your lists, and you'll need to use <code>:remote =&gt; true</code> to make it send AJAX requests to the server. The server will need to respond appropriately and supply HTML for your div. </p>

<p><code>link_to</code> documentation is here: <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to" rel="nofollow">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to</a> (and admittedly it isn't very useful for AJAX functionality).</p>

<p>The last post in <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/211467" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> shows one possible solution you could use.</p>
