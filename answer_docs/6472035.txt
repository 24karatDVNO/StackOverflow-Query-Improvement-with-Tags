<p>There's not much you can do re: <code>getElementsByClassName()</code> in raw JavaScript (except rolling your own), although Prototype has some good <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/api/element/getElementsByClassName" rel="nofollow noreferrer">functionality</a> for this.</p>

<p>Another possible approach: does the close button have a generic ID? If so, and if you're able to add plugins (sorry, I've never used Prototype), you could look at this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/460644/trigger-an-event-with-prototype">thread</a> to get an idea how to trigger the click event on that close button once you've selected it.</p>
