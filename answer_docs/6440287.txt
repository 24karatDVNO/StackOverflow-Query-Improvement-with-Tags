<p>You may want to check whether their is a Groovy package available in your distribution's package repository. I know there are binary packages for Debian and Ubuntu, as well as a source package in the ArchLinux AUR. Using your distribution's package manager is generally the easiest way to install things. It will also make it easier to uninstall it later.</p>
