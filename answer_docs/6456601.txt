<p>Eric84>dont know why. just copy .svn directory of project directory to new place,and update</p>

<p>@ERic84, since the .svn breadcrumb directory is used by SVN to monitor which files are under version control and which ones aren't, I'd beware of deleting it. I had a "skipped" problem and in my case deleting it for fun made the problem worse. The "skipped" message did not go away and the files that were supposed to be under SVN control were no longer getting their TortoiseSvn icons. Significantly, svn update did not restore the breadcrumb.</p>
