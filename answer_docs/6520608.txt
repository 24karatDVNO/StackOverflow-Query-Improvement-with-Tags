<p>i think there is nothing with the code what you have written but you should look at in to the plugin and find out whether it gives permission you to upload zip or not.</p>

<p>there will be conditions in your pluggin that you can upload only some kind of files like jpg,png,txt something like that.</p>

<p>I hope that helps you.</p>
