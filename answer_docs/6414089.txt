<p>The best way, IMHO would be to use a mmaped file, and then use regular expression to find what you are looking for.</p>

<pre><code> text = mmap.mmap(file)
 re.sub(pattern, text)
</code></pre>

<p>Mmap module maps a file as it were text, so you can perform pretty much any operations you would perform on a string. And the regex is the best way to search for something. Simple and efficient.</p>
