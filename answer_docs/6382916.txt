<p>You need to use a <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html" rel="nofollow">Content Provider</a> in your app.</p>

<p>From the Android Dev page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Content providers store and retrieve
  data and make it accessible to all
  applications. They're the only way to
  share data across applications;
  there's no common storage area that
  all Android packages can access.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, Application B will need to be aware of your provider and able to use it.</p>
