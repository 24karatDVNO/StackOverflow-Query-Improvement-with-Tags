<p>Declare your functions in C++ files. Since you defined your function in the header file, and that header file is included from multiple source files, it gets defined for each source file that includes it. That's why it's reported as being defined in multiple places.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could make it inline so that the code is inserted wherever it's used instead of being defined as a separate function each time.</p>
