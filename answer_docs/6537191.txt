<p>JSTL <strong>is a "custom tag library set"</strong> developed in and for the specifications of <strong>the J2EE server JSP servlet engine section</strong>. "Any tag in a Java J2EE spec. server markup page" configured for the java server written in Java2 J2EE spec <strong>is a "Custom Tag implementation" whether JSF , JSP , JSTL or Databasing cudtom</strong> tag. <em>However it is not a Java Bean (only extremely similar to them in syntax and semantic to write a class program).</em>
Each custom tag library has its own set of useful properties in java server markup and is why the system was developed. The Java Bean system is alike but is done through EL language.
A <strong>"tag"</strong> uses both a markup representation in the page and its co-bound(configured) <strong>.class file program</strong> in the server <strong>to process page markup and interface or join other server processes and programs</strong>.
<em>JSTL is simply java server markup library for the JSP-servelt engine as JSF is a markup for the faces-servlet engine and both are only a custom tag.</em></p>
