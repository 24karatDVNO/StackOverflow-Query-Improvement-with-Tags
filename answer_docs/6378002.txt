<p>I would phrase your procedure as a FUNCTION instead, and return the new ID to the caller:</p>

<pre><code>FUNCTION insert_user
(
    name_in IN users.name%TYPE,     
    age_in  IN users.age%TYPE   
)
    RETURN users.id%TYPE 
IS
    v_id users.id%TYPE;
BEGIN      
    INSERT INTO users (
        user_id, 
        name, 
        age
    ) VALUES (
        seq_user_id.nextval, 
        name_in, 
        age_in
    )
    RETURNING
        user_id
    INTO
        v_id
    ;    
    RETURN v_id;
END insert_user;
</code></pre>

<p>This is generally a more useful pattern for inserts, especially where you may want to subsequently insert child records in other tables.</p>
