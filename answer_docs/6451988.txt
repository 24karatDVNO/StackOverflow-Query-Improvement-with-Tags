<p>You should probably set a <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/swing/text/Document.html" rel="nofollow">Document</a> on your text box. You can implement a customer Document to filter for valid input to satisfy your requirements. Each time text is added or removed from your field, the Document will check if the overall input is valid.</p>
