<p>If you actually like the record to be entered into the DB one hour later you would have to create some kind of <strong>queue</strong> for your entries and setup a script (via <strong>Cron</strong> or other) that checks for records one hour old and inserts them into the database. You haven't specified which database you are working with, but as far as I know there is no DB that gives you the option to do an <strong>insert</strong> command but tell it to <strong>wait one hour before actually doing it</strong>.</p>

<p>If you use a queue then you could have a time stamp on it when the user created it and within one hour from that time stamp the user has the ability to cancel the record.</p>

<p>Your queue should probably reside in your DB as well and could actually be the actual table that the data is meant to end up in. Just use you time stamp to see if one hour has elapsed and mark the record as no longer <strong>cancelable</strong> (if that word exists... hehe). That would mean that the entry is actually written to the DB <strong>before</strong> one hour has passed. But you just have to filter your operations on whether or not an hour has passed since it's creation.</p>
