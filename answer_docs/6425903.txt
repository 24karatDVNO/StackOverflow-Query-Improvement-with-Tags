<p>This might answer it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>What constitutes a 'transaction' in
  the context of the transaction limits
  that apply to the Maps API?</strong> </p>
  
  <p>A single transaction occurs when:</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>the Maps JavaScript API (v2 or v3) is loaded by a web page or
  application; </li>
  <li>a SWF that loads the Maps API for Flash is loaded by a web page or
  application; </li>
  <li>or a single request is made for a map image from the Static Maps API. </li>
  </ol>
  
  <p>The degree to which a user interacts
  with a map once it has been loaded has
  no impact on the transaction limits.</p>
