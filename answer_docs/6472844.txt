<p>This is going way beyond a single comment of course. What you will eventually need is a dispatching mechanism to notify subscribers about the data record update. Since the amount of data is huge, you might not want to opt for a persistence storage. If the dispatching to multiple subscribers looks overwhelming so far, you can go with a simple interproc (via shared object (aka named pipes) for the consumer-provider to be on the same machine or something more distributed otherwise)</p>
