<p>If stack misalignment is the problem, you should check the <code>-mstackrealign</code> command line option, see <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/i386-and-x86_002d64-Options.html#index-mstackrealign-1349" rel="nofollow noreferrer">GCC documentation</a>. This solved my issues on MinGW target. See also the discussion on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2765294/gcc-how-to-realign-stack">stack alignment</a>. Finally, you might want to update GCC to a newer version.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you allocate objects dynamically, you must make sure that the memory is aligned, as Paul noted. There are methods like <code>_mm_malloc</code> and <code>_mm_free</code> that can help you with that. </p>
