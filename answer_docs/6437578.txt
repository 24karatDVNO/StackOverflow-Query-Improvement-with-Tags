<p>I would very, very strongly recommend using Objective-C and the Cocoa Touch frameworks as the basis for your app. UIKit is excellent at getting good looking, well performing UI quickly, and Xcode provides very nice development tools.</p>

<p>The iPad 2 is like the iPad 1, except that it's faster and has cameras, basically. Build for iPad 1 and you shouldn't expect any problems.</p>

<p>EDIT: Learn Objective-C and the Frameworks, it's not hard and provides great results. A very good book for people who know object-oriented programming and want to learn Objective-C and Cocoa Touch is <em>IPhone Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide</em>. Despite being targeted at iPhone development, its examples can be built for iPad with nearly zero changes (and by the time you get to a chapter where you need to make slight changes, you'lll know how to). Programming for iPhone and iPad are very nearly the same, with some differences in the availability of certain UI elements (and of course resolution and GUI/UX paradigm), as someone else already pointed out. This book will teach you the basics you won't instantly get from Apple's excellent documentation, and explain the reasoning behind certain pattern choices.</p>
