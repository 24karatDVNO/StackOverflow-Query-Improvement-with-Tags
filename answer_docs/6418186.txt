<p>As Michael already said, that's what Test Systems - VM's come in handy- are for</p>

<p>From my ant bookmarks => some years ago some tool called "Virtual Ant" has been announced, i never tried it. So don't regard it as a tip but as something someone heard of</p>

<p>From what the site says =</p>

<p>"With <a href="http://www.placidsystems.com/virtualant/Default.aspx" rel="nofollow"><strong>Virtual Ant</strong></a> you no longer have to get your hands dirty with XML to create or edit Ant build scripts. Work in a completely virtualized environment similar to Windows Explorer and run your tasks on a Virtual File System to see what they do, in real time, without affecting your real file system*. The actual Ant build script is generated in the background."</p>

<p>Hm, sounds to good to be true ;-)</p>

<p>..without affecting your real file system.. might be what you asked for !?<br>
They provide a 30day trial license so you won't lose no money but only the time to have a look on..</p>
