<p>If your div has padding maybe you should also sum the top and bottom paddings to the negative margin you're giving to it...</p>

<p>So for example if your div has 10px top and bottom margin, I think you should add 20px to its negative margins.</p>

<p>If there are elements with margin inside the footer that are pushing it down, maybe you should also add those margins to the negative margin of the footer.</p>
