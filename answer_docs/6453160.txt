<p>I don't internals of git but following works for me.</p>

<pre><code>git reset --hard &lt;SHA of commit one commit before your first local commit &gt; ( If commit order is RA-B-C if B and C are local commits RA is SHA you have to give) 

git merge --squash ORIG_HEAD

git commit
</code></pre>

<p>It will be great if someone can explain this.</p>
