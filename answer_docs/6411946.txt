<p>No, there isn't</p>

  <p>The problem is since I am uploading a huge video?</p>

<p>Shouldn't be. However there may be problems with the way you are doing it. There could be 2 possible problems here (that I'm able to sense):</p>

<ol>
<li>You are performing the upload operation on the main thread (deadly sin !).</li>
<li>With a long video you are experiencing a connectivity problem.</li>
</ol>

<p>For any of these to detect, see what the logcat has to say ! Post the output here if you can.</p>
