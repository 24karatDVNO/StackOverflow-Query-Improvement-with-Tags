<p>Since you're going to be dynamically adding controls to your form, you'd simply want to put in a panel where you want the textbox and the button. Inside that panel place your textbox and button, you'd probably not want to use netbeans to do this, and use a LayoutManager like GridLayout. Now you'lld want to connect your button to an ActionListener that adds a textfiield to the panel.</p>
