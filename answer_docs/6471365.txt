<p>the only way I know would be to submit the form to a hidden iframe. this will upload teh file without refreshing the page. you can then use any returned info using javascript. this is what they use for <em>fake ajax</em> style image uploads that let you preview an image before <em>uploading</em>. the truth is it already has been uploaded via a hidden iframe. unfortunately however iframes are not xhtml 1.0 compliant.</p>

<p>something like this article may help:
