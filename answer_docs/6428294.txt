<p>You can get the activities that the tabhost is running, with this:</p>

<pre><code>YourActivity act = (YourActivity) getLocalActivityManager().getActivity(TABKEY_1);
</code></pre>

<p>then call any method you have in that activity. TABKEY_1 is just the name for the tab that you give when you initialized the tabhost. </p>
