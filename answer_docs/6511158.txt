<p>Take a look at the Pager example: <a href="http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager2.html" rel="nofollow">http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/pager2.html</a></p>

<p>The pager features takes the user to a specific image in the cycle, which is what you want to do.</p>

<p>However, you might only want to implement a single pager link, not a link for each image in the cycle.</p>
