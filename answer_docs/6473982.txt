<p>No, they won't. But trust me, it will be a nightmare if you don't pay attention, Subversion's not at all smart in such situations.</p>

<p>If at all possible, make them commit every change, update your working copy and <em>only then</em> can you start shuffling stuff around without causing much grief.</p>

<p>Do anything else and you're screwed.</p>

<p>I'm assuming you don't have branches, because if you do, the next merge will be painful.</p>
