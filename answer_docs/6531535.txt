<p>This question was in the result list when I was researching the same issue, however I found the following code</p>

<pre><code>print object_name(@@PROCID) 
</code></pre>

<p>which works a treat within a stored proc, to return the name of the stored proc which contained it. The original article I found at <a href="http://www.sqlservercentral.com/Forums/Topic813548-146-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">sql server central</a>.</p>
