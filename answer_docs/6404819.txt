<p>Hardware side: Most light sensors are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photodiode" rel="nofollow">Photodiodes</a>. When exposed to light, they create a current. The brighter the light, the higher the current. This current is then "converted" to a sequence of bits.</p>

<p>(Purely theory from now on) This is then sent to the part of the OS handling the light sensor. It will recieve different values (Oh yeah, there's a load of light, here's a value of 64000 for you / Nope, pretty dark right now, have a 200) and do whatever he's supposed to do with these values.</p>
