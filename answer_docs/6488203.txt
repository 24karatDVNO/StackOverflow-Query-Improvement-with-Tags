<p>An example, you declared your "birthday" as datetime
command.Parameters.Add(new MySqlParameter("@birthday", SqlDbType.DateTime));</p>

<p>but, your value is being inserted as 
command.Parameters["@birthday"].Value = addbday.Text; // which im not sure if you are in the right format or not.  </p>

<p>That's why you have format error.  </p>
