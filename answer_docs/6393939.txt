<p>Can you verify it is just your working environment that is having the issue?  I have ran into many times when VS will force me to checkout files without my wanting it to happen.  In almost every case it ended up being that one developer installed a SP and updated the project files while all other developers were on a different SP.</p>

<p>Another option you have here is to turn off this automatic checkout feature <a href="http://www.woodwardweb.com/teamprise/disabling_tfs_a.html" rel="nofollow">here is a walkthrough</a></p>

<p>Granted, that may not be an ideal solution but it will resolve the problem short-term.  I would do a compare on the project files to see what is being changed.</p>

<p>Hopefully these ideas will help you avoid the frown face.</p>
