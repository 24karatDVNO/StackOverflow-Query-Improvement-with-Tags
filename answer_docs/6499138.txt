<p>You could concat the <code>CatType</code> and the <code>ID</code> to get a unique string as key for the <code>SortedList</code>(f.e. <code>"P4711"</code> and <code>"S12345"</code>). </p>

<p>But normally i would use two SortedList, one for every category. That makes the code less error-prone and more legible.</p>
