<p>For every page I write, I open a single connection object, then use that same connection object for all my recordsets as the "ActiveConnection" property of the recordset, then close the connection object when I'm done working. </p>

<p>Example: </p>

<pre><code>Dim cn
Set cn = CreateObject("Adodb.Connection")
cn.Open MyDsnString

Dim rs1
Set rs1 = CreateObject("Adodb.Recordset")
rs1.ActiveConnection = cn
rs1.source = "some query"
rs1.Open

'... (stuff happens here) '

rs1.Close
Set rs1 = Nothing

'... (stuff happens here) '

Dim rs2
Set rs2 = CreateObject("Adodb.Recordset")
rs2.ActiveConnection = cn
rs2.source = "select something from sometable"
rs2.Open

'... (stuff happens here) '

rs2.Close
Set rs2 = Nothing

'... (stuff happens here) '

cn.Close
Set cn = Nothing
</code></pre>

<p>That way there's only one connection open for the entire page, and it's very efficient.</p>
