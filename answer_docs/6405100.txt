<p>In Rails you normally want pages routing to resources. For example if you have a Project model, then you would route to /projects, which will call your ProjectsController#index action</p>

<pre><code>#in config/routes.rb
resources :projects
</code></pre>

<p>For something like /index.html, I'll assume your looking to map to some home landing page. In this case you would want the url to be "/" and you can map that to a controller like</p>

<pre><code>#in config/routes.rb
# This assumes you have a HomepageController with an index action and a view in app/views/homepage/index.html.erb
root :to =&gt; "homepage#index"
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you really do want "/index.html" then you can use this</p>

<pre><code># in config/routes.rb
get "/index" =&gt; "homepage#index"
</code></pre>
