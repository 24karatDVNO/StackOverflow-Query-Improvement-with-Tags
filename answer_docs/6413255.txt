<p>If you already have the upload count, you could also use <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replace.html" rel="nofollow">REPLACE</a>.</p>

<pre><code>REPLACE INTO wuploaders (userid, uploads) VALUES ($userid, $count);
</code></pre>

<p>The solution of @a1ex07 might be good either way though :)</p>
