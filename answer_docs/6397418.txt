<p>You could put a container around your form with the maximum width that you want to allow your elements to go, and then give it either <code>overflow: auto</code> if you want the elements to wrap if they are too long, <code>overflow: hidden</code> if you want the elements to disappear if they are too long, or <code>overflow: scroll</code> if you want there to be a horizontal scrollbar added if they are too long.</p>
