<p>I'd say GWT is as capable as any other tool that you're likely to use. We use GWT here for a medium-size application with various different modules and so on (built using different Maven module configurations) and it works well. Probably the best out of all the Java style UI solutions I've used.</p>

<p>In general I'd say GWT is definitely ready for a large-scale enterprise application - I'd say it's good to use unless you're doing a public-facing website where accessibility is a concern!</p>
