<p>I'm usually create a widget like HeaderWidget with few view files and include in main layout. In controller or action define necessary view file of header and pass them into widget.</p>

<p>In base controller you can define property public $headerName = 'defaultHeaderView'
And set value depends of some conditions.</p>

<p>Of cource, you need to create BController extends CController and all other controllers extends from your BController</p>
