<p>I used to have an Acer laptop and at least some of the Acer supplied utilities (called something like Acer Empowering Technology tools) used it.</p>

<p>Don't have access to the laptop now, but I did google search for 'acer empowering log4net' just to check my memory wasn't faulty.</p>

<p>If you are just looking for logos, then the first link that came up in the search <a href="http://www.exe-dll.com/dll/log4net.dll.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.exe-dll.com/dll/log4net.dll.htm</a> also shows some other possible users including LinkSys, Motorola</p>
