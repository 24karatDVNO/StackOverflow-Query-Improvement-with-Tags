<p>We just had this issue. The problem turned out to be that Nginx was using a different config file than we thought it was (possibly an issue with how it was compiled on the server?).</p>

<p>We discovered this by doing <code>nginx -t</code>, which lists the config file it's reading and tests the syntax. The one it said it was testing was not the one we expected.</p>
