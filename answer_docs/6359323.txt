<p>You have to create a form to submit the data of the <em>checked</em> checkboxes and treate the submited result with the php code : if you want to put the php code on the same page, you can check if there is any data in the POST vars and create a SQL Query to delete the corresponding pictures.</p>

<p>You can find a very well documented tutorial here : <a href="http://sharemyphp.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/ajax-jquery-php-multiple-delete-item-with-check-box/" rel="nofollow">http://sharemyphp.wordpress.com/2009/12/21/ajax-jquery-php-multiple-delete-item-with-check-box/</a></p>
