<p>Just for reference, the way to do this turned out to be creating a standard installer and then solving the default install paths by using a batch script and passing through to setup.exe the TARGETDIR param.</p>

<pre><code>setup.exe TARGETDIR="C:\App"
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks all for your answers!</p>
