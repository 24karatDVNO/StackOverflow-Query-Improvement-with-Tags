<p>Yes and no. The form should be given a landmark role of "form". This allows the assistive technology to see the landmark for navigation purposes. </p>

<p>Refer to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/roles#form" rel="nofollow">spec</a>.</p>

<p>While using the landmark will aid in navigating the page, the landmark itself won't produce the reading of the items in the form itself. Following the already known HTML practices mentioned will take care of the rest.</p>
