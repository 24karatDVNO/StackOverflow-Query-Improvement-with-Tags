<p>Solution was really simple!!</p>

<p>If you have a DateTime property binded to a textbox, it's enought to set "ValidatesOnExceptions=True" on Binding instruction from XAML.</p>

<p>If you just want to parse this by youself, you have to use ValidatesOnDataErrors=True and make a validation function to raise a message.</p>
