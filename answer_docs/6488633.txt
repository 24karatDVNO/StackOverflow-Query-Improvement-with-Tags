<p>A package can specify itself using the zip_safe flag inside its setup.py file if it should be unarchived or not. In addition most installers like 'easy_install' provide options to control the unpacking explicitly (e.g. easy_install --zip-ok ...)...so it may depend on how the packages are installed under Fedora oder CentOS.</p>
