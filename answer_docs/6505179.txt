<p>I assume you mean "holds some value" like in "the variable has been created so it exists", right? Otherwise, your approach works perfectly fine.</p>

<p>If you want to check whether a variable exists in javascript, you have to check its parent object for the property - otherwise the script will fail. Each object in javascript belongs to a parent object, even if it seems to be global (then, it belongs to the window object). So, try something like:</p>

<pre>
  if (window.DEST_VALUE) 
    // do something
</pre>
