<p>Set yourself as a scrum-like team, identify a product owner (who would represent customers) and come up with Definition of Done for each of the story on the table. </p>

<p>That will help you to balance time investments as the team members will be clear on what they need to do in order to have stories/tasks done. Let them self-organize and come up with the right strategy in regard Unit tests and E2E tests. </p>

<p>As long they meet the DoD - they are hitting right balance...</p>

<p>Unit tests are quite different from E2E tests - different skills are required to develop them etc. Both of them are equally important and it is not easy cut to say where to invest (and where to 'cut conrners') - it depends on the nature of the product that your team builds - you might be able to manage it. </p>

<p>I think running it like a scrum team (agile) - review and adapt often - will help you to hit right balance.</p>
