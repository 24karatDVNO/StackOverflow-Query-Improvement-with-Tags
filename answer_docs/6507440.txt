<p>This also depends on the architecture of your client. If you are using something like MVC, you may have the necessity to create large amounts of ViewModels. If your WCF services are granular, it may make sense to make the services return strongly typed DTO objects. If you share the DLL containing the service contracts with your client, you will be able to use the DTOs contained in the service responses as ViewModels. You get the advantage of scaling your UI application and your business logic middle ware differently by decoupling them in this way.</p>
