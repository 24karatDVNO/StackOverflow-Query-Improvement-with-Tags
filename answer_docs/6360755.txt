<p>Correct me if I a mistaken, but isn't the point of things like <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Ant</a> to have a build process in Java itself?  I feel that if you had a standardized Java build process that did these things for you, your batch file, bash script, or the necessary derivatives could be much, much simpler.  Then again, IANAJDNEC (I am not a Java developer, not even close).</p>
