<p>The last time I did any work with 3DS was around 1999-2000. Back then it had an 'Export to VRML' feature - if this is still the case you could almost certainly convert (tools are available) VRML to X3D for use with HTML5's Canvas. </p>

<p>You might find @ViennaMike 's answer to <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5497697/is-there-a-high-level-vrml-like-api-for-doing-3d-with-html5">my earlier (related) question</a> useful for some pointers. He links to some demos and an FAQ.</p>
