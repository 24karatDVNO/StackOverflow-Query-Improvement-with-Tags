<p>A <code>char</code> is a single character. When we do <code>char*</code> or <code>char[]</code> it allows us to store multiple chars on the the computer. This also means, you cannot access non-pointer chars like an array as you attempted to do (since arrays are essentially convient form of pointers when it comes to storing stuff).</p>

<p>You can change your code to the following:</p>

<pre><code>union mytypes1_t {
    unsigned long mylong;
    char *mychar;
} mytypes1;
</code></pre>
