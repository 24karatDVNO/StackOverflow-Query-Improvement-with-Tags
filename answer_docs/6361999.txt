<p>The problem is SVN knows about merging only in one way, only tree that you commit after merge knows that it was merge (in 1.5+).
In my opinion You have conflicts because SVN try to make changes to branch that are from branch and was merged to trunk. 
Try first to merge commit(s) to trunk that are merged from branch with --record-only.
record-only does only cahnge merge-info property. After that merge (and commit to branch) You should be able to merge another commits from trunk. </p>
