<p>I have a similar problem and plan to use a subview to hold all the "completed" paths and another subview to hold just the path "in progress". This way I don't have to draw all the completed paths as I get new touchesmoved events for the "in progress" path(s). Once the path is complete, I move it to the completed array, redraw the completed subview, and await the next touch. This avoids the "trillions of subviews" problem, and also avoids redrawing the whole array of paths while actually trying to respond to touches, which are very sensitive to delays. Once I get this going, I'll try to remember to return here with some code.</p>
