<p>You have a few choices. Learn Objective C and drop Titanium since it can't do what you are asking or upload your files to a server somewhere combine them and then download the single combined file. The other is what Muhammad is saying where you create your own custom timers and use the <code>duration</code> and <code>looping</code> values to make it play out correctly. Personally I would go with the server method.</p>
