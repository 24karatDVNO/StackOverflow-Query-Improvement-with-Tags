<p>For learning to parse xml, look at the links Brandon provided.  Your requirement to build an array of classes from xml is something you'll need to create yourself.</p>

<p>A suggestion I have for you is instead of creating classes, just put the data into a <code>NSMutableArray</code>.  The array will contain <code>NSDictionary</code> objects for food sub-items.</p>
