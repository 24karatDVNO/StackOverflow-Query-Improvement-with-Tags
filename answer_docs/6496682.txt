<p>Looking at your comment, I think what you want is this -</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE Invent
SET Advanced = ISNULL(Item_Pending,0) -
    ISNULL(Total_items,0) - ISNULL(Items_Pres,0) 
WHERE Item_Name = "'" + DropItemName.SelectedValue + "'";
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>DropItemsName.SelectedValue</code> seems to be the value you are substituting from your UI code.</p>
