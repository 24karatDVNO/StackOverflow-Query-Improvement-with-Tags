<p>Provide full path of your cfc. If you your EasySelection is under CFC folder then it should be cfc:cfc.EasySelection. If you are running under localhost with seperate directory then you may need write something like cfc:[your application folder path].cfc.EasySelection.</p>

<p>In short you need to provide relative path of cfc from root of your website.</p>
