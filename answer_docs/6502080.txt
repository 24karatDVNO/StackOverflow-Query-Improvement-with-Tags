<p>There is a <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/FastMathParser.aspx" rel="nofollow">Code Project</a> where this problem was addressed.  Note this is for C++ -- sorry just saw that you're looking for C / Objective-C.  As it builds a library, you could write a simple interface and expose it to C.  There's a really succinct <a href="http://developers.sun.com/solaris/articles/mixing.html" rel="nofollow">explanation here</a> of how to go about doing this.</p>
