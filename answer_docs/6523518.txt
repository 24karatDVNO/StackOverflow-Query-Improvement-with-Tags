<p>When you issue the following command at the mysql prompt:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE database &lt;database_name&gt;;
</code></pre>

<p>You should be presented with the typical "Ok" prompt afterwards. You should then be able to do :</p>

<pre><code>show databases;
</code></pre>

<p>That will show you a list of databases on the system and in there you should see the database you created.</p>
