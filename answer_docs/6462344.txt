<p>You absolutely do, at least for a bigger projects that take a few months. For the past years I tried :</p>

<ol>
<li>eclipse notepad plugin - just text file - effective</li>
<li>eclipse mylyn tasks - better, enough for one-man-show, but I was still having issues with migration between eclipse instances</li>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/" rel="nofollow">youtrack</a></strong> is free and it's like a JIRA but more simple and practical for an individualist </li>
</ol>

<p>With notepad I was able to focus on current task, but I wasn't able to maintain long term iterations, because without issue tracker I was loosing discipline, dealing with 3 tasks at the same time, not finishing them, etc.</p>
