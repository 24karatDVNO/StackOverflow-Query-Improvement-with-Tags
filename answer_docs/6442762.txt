<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(member_id) JOIN membertomshiptable USING(member_id)
     JOIN membershipstatustypetable ON mshipstatustype_id=membershipstatustype_id
     WHERE membertomship_startdate &lt;= 'XXXX-XX-XX' 
     AND membershipstatusname='complete'
</code></pre>

<p>If you know the status ID you want to check you could avoid the last JOIN. You might also need to specify an end date as well if you're looking for a specific month.</p>
