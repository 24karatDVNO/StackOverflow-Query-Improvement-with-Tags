<p>A lot of the frameworks will abstract your view technology.  For example, you can use Spring with JSPs, JSF, GWT from Google, Flex, etc.  Grails uses SiteMesh which I've come to enjoy.  I believe Play! uses straight-up Groovy files, or at least did until recent releases.   </p>

<p>Tiles2 is also pretty easy to use, and gives you some of the basic "manage the parts" functionality so you don't wind up going down the include rabbit hole. </p>

<p>Here is a great tutorial that walks through a simple Spring MVC webapp with Tiles2 to help manage the JSPs.  This will also give you a feel for view resolvers within Spring. </p>
