<p>You might want to take a lot at MSDN's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/1c9txz50.aspx" rel="nofollow">Managed Threading Best Practices</a>, particularly the note about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460693.aspx" rel="nofollow">Parallel Programming in the .NET Framework</a>. Plus I'd personally recommend you to rely on a logging framework such as <a href="http://logging.apache.org/" rel="nofollow">Apache log4net</a>.</p>
