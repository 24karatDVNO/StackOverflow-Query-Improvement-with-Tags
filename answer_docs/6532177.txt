<p>I also think a semaphore is what you're looking for. In .NET 4.0, however, there might be another way for you as well. If you like 5 threads to run the same code concurrently, you could put it into a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>Task</code></a> and use a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>TaskScheduler</code></a> to make .NET spawn at most 5 threads. Just set the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.taskscheduler.maximumconcurrencylevel.aspx" rel="nofollow"><code>MaximumConcurrencyLevel</code></a> property.</p>

<p>This does not do any semaphore-like thinks, so other threads might enter into the section too! See also <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd460717.aspx" rel="nofollow">Task Parallel Library (MSDN)</a> for more information.</p>
