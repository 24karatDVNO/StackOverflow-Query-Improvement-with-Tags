<p>I am unaware of an existing TableModel or TreeModel link or tool to use with CouchDB. Hopefully others can give some advice.</p>

<p>Based on your question, I would suggest a preliminary project to make a prototype, to gain knowledge about persisting TableModel and TreeModel in CouchDB. Nothing fancy! Perhaps spend a few hours or a day or weekend trying some ideas. Usually, once you are comfortable with the problem and some solutions, it is much more obvious what is the best option.</p>

<p>To store on CouchDB, serializing to JSON sounds smart. Usually, the simplest technique will give the best bang-for-buck. I also suggest the wiki about using <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/Getting_started_with_Java" rel="nofollow">CouchDB with Java</a>. There are many free tools, and each tool balances the pros/cons differently.</p>
