<p>Ya I have had this problem too. Its something to do with flash and that effect not playing nicely. </p>

<p>I have been able to find a work around though. Take out the  HTML and use the <a href="http://jquery.thewikies.com/swfobject/" rel="nofollow">SWFObject plugin</a> to embed the flash file after you have told the dialog to open. The code would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>$(function () {
    $("#modal").dialog({
        autoOpen: false,
        width: 750,
        height: 635,
        modal: true,
        show: "scale",
        hide: "fade",
        close: function (event, ui) {
            $("#modal").empty();
        }
    });
    $("#video a").click(function () {
        $("#modal").dialog('open');
        $("#modal").flash({
            swf: 'video.swf',
            width: 720,
            height: 526
        });
        return false;
    })
});
</code></pre>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
