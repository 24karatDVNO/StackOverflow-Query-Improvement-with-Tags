<p>An emulator won't help much to fix a problem with a specific device.</p>

<p>First of all you should acquire a stacktrace from the user using the Android Market or an EMail intent.</p>

<p>After that you can try to reproduce the problem using a service like <a href="http://www.deviceanywhere.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.deviceanywhere.com/</a> for example.</p>
