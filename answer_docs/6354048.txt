<p>It is possible, you need following steps: thresholding image, some morphological enhancement,
 blob extraction and normalization of blob size, blobs shape analysis, comparison of analysis results with pattern that you want to track.</p>

<p>There is many methods for blobs shape analysis. Simple methods: geometric dimensions, area, perimeter, circularity measurement; bit quads and others (for example, William K. Pratt "Digital Image Processing", chapter 18). Complex methods: spacial moments, template matching, neural networks and others.</p>

<p>In any event, it is very hard to answer exactly without knowledge of pattern shapes that you want to track )</p>

<p>hope it helped</p>
