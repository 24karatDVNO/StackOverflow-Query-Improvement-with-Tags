<p>When I used MySqlParameter, it was working with a ? character, not with the @ character. This might your problem here; eg:</p>

<pre><code>new MySqlParameter("?MachineSimulatorDb");
</code></pre>

<p>But Andomar is probably correct that you can't use a MySqlParameter to feed the name of the new database.</p>
