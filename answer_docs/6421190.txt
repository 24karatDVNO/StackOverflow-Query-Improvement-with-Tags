<p>heres the changes that you need to do:
//both the view and the editext should be declared as final and the findViewById method needs a layout on which it is to be called</p>

<ul>
<li>final View layout = View.inflate(this, R.layout.alertbox, null);
<ul>
<li>final EditText placeText = (EditText) layout.findViewById(R.id.strtplace);</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
