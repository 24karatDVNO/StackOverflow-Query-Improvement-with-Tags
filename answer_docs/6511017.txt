<p>I would include a userId in your ViewModel or add it on the URL so the controller can pick it up.</p>

<p>After validating the password combo you use the Id to retrieve the relevant User and update it with the new password. You can just do this within your new password post action.</p>

<p>You may want to match with the old password btw. </p>
