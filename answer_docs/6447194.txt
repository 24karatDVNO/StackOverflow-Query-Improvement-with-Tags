<p>I was having a similar problem, I had installed the telerik .msi and then copied the libs I needed to a lib folder in my project and referenced them.  Another person working on it got the same error, I believe.  It has to do with <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/566804/when-adding-a-reference-using-the-browse-tab-visual-studio-2010-does-not-add-the-hintpath-node-to-a-silverlight-4-csproj" rel="nofollow">this</a>.  I ended up uninstalling, basically removing the telerik controls from the gac and just using the dll's download.  Maybe your colleague installed the msi? </p>
