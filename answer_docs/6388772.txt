<p>Are you using any source control system?  It's not clear if your problem is simply the mechanics of making a build, or how to keep a copy of your source that corresponds to each build.  If the answer is b, then a source control system is designed to solve this problem.</p>

<p>You would make a build each day and publish/release the binaries, while at the same time checking in your source code.  That way you have a "copy" of your source code that corresponds to each released build, while still allowing you to continue active development.</p>
