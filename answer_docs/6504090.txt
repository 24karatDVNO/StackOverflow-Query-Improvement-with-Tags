<p>I answered similar question recently <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2570991/implement-alphabetical-scroll-in-mpmediapickercontroller-app/6484422#6484422">here</a></p>

<p>As far as i know you cannot customize the MPMediaPickerController yourself beyond of course what is stated in the documentation.</p>

<p>You will need to implement your own picker, using media queries (by song ,by artist, etc).</p>

<p>I suggest reading: “Using the iPod Library” in Apple's "iPod Library Access Programming Guide"</p>
