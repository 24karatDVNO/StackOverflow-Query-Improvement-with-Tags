<p>The information you want to display is platform specific. /proc (procfs) is standard mechanism in modern UNIXes. The <a href="http://www.petertribble.co.uk/Solaris/jproc.html" rel="nofollow">jproc</a> is JNI to proc file system. You may find it very useful.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As if accessing kstats from Java
  wasn't enough, I've recently been
  playing with accessing process
  information - specifically the /proc
  filesystem on Solaris - from java.
  Thus was born JProc.</p>
  
  <p>The idea, eventually, is to link this
  with JKstat and SolView to give a more
  complete view of what's happening on a
  Solaris system.</p>
