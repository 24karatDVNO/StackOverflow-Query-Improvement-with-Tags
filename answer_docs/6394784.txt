<p>What are you trying to ask here? It still equals <code>5,5,5</code>, because that's the array you are referencing! So, <code>myArray.toString()</code> will result in <code>5,5,5</code>, which is exactly what you get alerted.</p>

<p>You are instantiating two different objects there, so they are behaving the way they are expected to. They will never affect one another, if that's what you are asking.</p>
