<p>The obvious question is why you would want to pass a string to a UILabel and not even show it all? Either way, it isn't very memory efficient as it will store the full data in memory, but as tc. mentions, for as string of reasonable size length as you are dealing with, it's hardly going to cause too much of a memory issue.</p>

<p>I would recommend just to leave it unless you are experiencing noticable memory issues in your app.</p>
