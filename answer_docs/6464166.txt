<p>I think the logic in your code is wrong. It is a bit convoluted and hard to follow. I would recommend rewriting it a bit to be simpler. Something like this might help get you started. It collects all the windows, putts all the tabs into the <code>tabs</code> var.</p>

<pre><code>var tabs = [];
chrome.windows.getAll({ populate: true}, function(windows) {
  var localTabs = windows.reduce(function(a, b){
    return a.tabs.concat(b.tabs);
  });
  tabs = localTabs.filter(function(element){
    return !element.incognito;
  });
})
</code></pre>
