<p>Depending on what kind of effect you are going for, you can most likely use some css to mimic such an effect.</p>

<p>Have you tried using:</p>

<pre><code>div.transparent
   {
   background-image:"imageLocation.jpg"

   /* for IE */
   filter:alpha(opacity=60);
   /* CSS3 standard */
   opacity:0.6;
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Then just <code>&lt;div class="transparent"&gt;</code> for your div.</p>

<p>The opacity property effects everything in the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. However, I think you can override it by adding another class with opacity 1.0 for your content.</p>

<p>Just a thought.</p>
