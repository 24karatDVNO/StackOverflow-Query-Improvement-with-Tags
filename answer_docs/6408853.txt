<p>If looking for the text you can read the entire text out of the top table and parse it to what you're looking for. This is how I reduced a lot of overhead in table searches until I realised I couldn't identify empty table cells, now I have to do things the slow way, but it may help you if you're not interested in the position of the displayed text.</p>

<p>Otherwise... not really. Unless something defined an inner table (or its parent/child) that is excluded from the outer table it's hard to identify it.</p>
