<p>Assuming you have a bunch of N documents and you:</p>

<p>Want to find out if Document X (containing an article on how to be a bodybuilder) is similar to another Document Y whose contents you do not know.  If Document Y would be "similar" to Document X, it might contain the usual terms one associates with bodybuilding - eg: weight-lifting, barbells, dumbells and maybe Arnold.</p>

<p>So, the similarity of Document X, Document Y would be pretty high.  One way to measure this similarity, is using the Cosine Angle between these two documents.</p>
