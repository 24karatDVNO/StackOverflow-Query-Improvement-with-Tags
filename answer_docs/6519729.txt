<p>Each of those methods passes in a reference to the table view that's calling it. I usually connect each table to an outlet in interface builder and conditionally return the datasource based on a comparison with tableView in the delegate methods and the outlet names. Doing so with a tag is also possible but messier and more open to complications when editing your view structure.  </p>
