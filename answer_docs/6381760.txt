<p>Doing some more research ( Google ), I ended up checking r/Groovy on reddit and was led to <a href="http://www.mengu.net/post/annotating-your-grails-controller-classes-and-actions" rel="nofollow">this</a> very useful blog post </p>

<p>From my perspectives, Java annotations can be used to decorate or markup methods with extended logic.  So something like</p>

<pre><code> class Root {
    @Expose
    void index() {
      #som sort of logic here
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>And then use Java annotations to detect the @Expose annotation.</p>
