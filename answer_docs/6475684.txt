<p>That my friend is <strong>JetBrains' Resharper</strong> - it's a paid add-in to Visual Studio that allows you to run tests from within the IDE. Highly recommended if you're working for a prolonged period in VS.</p>

<p>Of course since you're just starting out, you could use the NUnit GUI to run your tests. You can also set it to run tests after each build. 
<code>Tools &gt; Settings &gt; Test Loader &gt; Assembly Reload. Check "Re-Run last tests run". Apply changes</code></p>
