<p>I have worked on similar one i used following see this might help you.</p>

<p>Using Selenium IDE.<br/>
1. Navigate to the required page.<br/>
2. Start selenium IDE and Get the Link target.<br/>
3. Change the Command to <strong>mouseOver</strong> Double click the the command in Selenium IDE.<br/>
4. It will Show the link wchich you needed.<br/>
5. Again Start recording and record the required Link.<br/></p>

<p>When you Double click the mouseOver command it creates the simulation of mouse over through IDE and you can Use your mouse to record the popup link.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
