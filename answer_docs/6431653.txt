<p>When you create an object with the, say, sequence-derived surrogate primary key, you pass it to the Hibernate session with that field set to the value that Hibernate interprets as "not assigned", by default 0. This field is not populated with the assigned value until the corresponding record is not inserted into the database table. You can trigger insertion by either explicitly calling flush() on the hibernate session or performing a database read in the same session. After that you can check the value of that field and it will be assigned rather than 0. </p>
