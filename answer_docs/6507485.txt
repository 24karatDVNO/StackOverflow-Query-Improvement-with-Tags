<p>Maybe you could try the following sequence :</p>

<ul>
<li>Find the part you want to change (numbers seperated by <code>-</code> and parts) with the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa221467%28v=office.11%29.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer"><code>Find</code></a> function (another <a href="http://www.xtremevbtalk.com/showthread.php?t=125085" rel="nofollow noreferrer">link</a>) and a well-formed regexp (meant <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/replace_using_wildcards.htm" rel="nofollow noreferrer">wildcards</a> for Word)</li>
<li>Set the brackets at the beginning and at the end of the matched element (use the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/497624/vba-word-range-question">range object</a>)</li>
<li>Delete the last word ("part") - or whatever you want to do</li>
<li>Loop through every results to do the same (see an example of looping through find function <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6369177/find-italic-fonts-in-word-document-using-vba/">here</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't forget you can record macro if you are looking for some tips or specific objects (even if the code produced is less complete than the one produced by Excel vba).</p>

<p>Please don't hesitate to post some code if you want some more help,</p>

<p>Regards,</p>
