<p>Why? Users don't like to wait. However, if you need to wait because you're loading some data, you can:</p>

<pre><code>public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState){
    super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
    setContentView(R.layout.splash);

    /* Do some work in a new thread, calling setContentView at the end with your view */
}
</code></pre>
