<p>You can do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>select sum(sumcol) FROM (
    select sum(col) as sumcol from table1
    union all
    select sum(col) as sumcol from table2
    union all
    select sum(col) as sumcol from table3
    ...
    union all
    select sum(col) as sumcol from table100
);
</code></pre>

<p>This is done with much less memory consumption when you sum-up in union parts, too.</p>
