<p>Assuming your model is back to the root directory, try to clean your project (using XCode's Clean All menu item). If that doesn't work then you might have to rebuild your model, or as a last resort, start a new project and copy things over as you need them (Do this in XCode, NOT in Finder).</p>

<p>As a general rule do not move files on disk. Let XCode handle the organization otherwise you will confuse it.</p>
