<p>This might be a little late, but here is the answer anyway: Unfortunately, you can't pan in 3DTools. There is an "Enhanced" version which includes panning and it can be found <a href="http://www.kindohm.com/archive/2006/02/01/TrackballsInWPF.html" rel="nofollow">here.</a>
Unfortunately, this is outdated as well an you will need to do some work before it compiles, but it might be a starting point.</p>
