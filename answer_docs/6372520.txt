<p>You will have to play around with Bitmaps, color transformations  matrix  and   alpha channel.   </p>

<p>Like this (do not have code to copypaste at hand) :
1. Create alpha channel bitmap from black pixels  via color matrix ( black -> alpha 1 )
2. bucket fill green rectangle over alpha channel
3. bucket fill blue rectangle over alpha channel
4. draw over original bitmap</p>
