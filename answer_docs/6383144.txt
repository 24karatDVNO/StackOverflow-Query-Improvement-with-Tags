<p>You could use a library for that. For example i like <code>Qt</code> but it tends to be large but it is multiplatform. You could also use <code>Win32++</code> for that. But it requires some reading since it is very close to the windows api (WinAPI).</p>

<p>Just for completeness there is also ATL, WTL, MFC, GTK (multiplatform), wxWidgets and some others i don't recall.</p>
