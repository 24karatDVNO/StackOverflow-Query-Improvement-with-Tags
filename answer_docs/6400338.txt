<p>What do you mean by "so that every objects created from this class (in this case with new) can inject"? If you're instantiating objects in your <code>Application</code> class using <code>new</code>, then I think that's your problem. Essentially, Guice replaces <code>new</code>. You'll need to instantiate your service objects with Guice (either by injecting them, or using <code>injector.getInstance()</code>) in order for their members or constructors to be injected by Guice.</p>
