<p>I too am trying to use py2exe from paver.  However, I ran into <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/paver/browse_thread/thread/5eb90f12298edc5a/1e14403b32152f42" rel="nofollow">the problem described here</a> and from that (and some other googling around) my conclusion is that the two aren't integrated and that the cleanest thing to do is to maintain a separate setup.py for py2exe and hope <a href="http://distutils2.notmyidea.org/" rel="nofollow">distutils2</a> improves things.</p>

<p>However, I would be very happy to be proven wrong..</p>
