<p>It seems to be a Youtube App bug, because I just tested with a Private Video I do not own, but I have access to on the Mac via Safari. My Youtube App is connected onto my Youtube account, but I still get the "Youtube not available" message for that video if I try to open it via url through Mail App. Public videos work fine. </p>
