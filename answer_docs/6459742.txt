<p>I followed all of the above advisals, but MDS didn't still start! </p>

<p>What was wrong? I had installed J2EE (java_ee_sdk-5_01-windows.exe) instead of J2SE (jdk-6u26-windows-i586.exe), with the latter MDS worked properly</p>

<p>This installation lost me one awful day and a terrible night.</p>
