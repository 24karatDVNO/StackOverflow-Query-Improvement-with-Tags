<p>Declaring a file object pointing at "directory" means that the file object will end up pointing to <code>&lt;jvm running directory&gt;/directory</code> . The jvm running directory is generally whatever directory you launch the jvm from. Try using the full path to the directory and see if it works.</p>

<p>Otherwise, please provide some sample output as well as the expected output.</p>
