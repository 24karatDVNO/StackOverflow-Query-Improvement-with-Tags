<p>Either mark your thread MTA (provided it's not the UI thread which has to be STA) or use a different wait mechanism.  For example, you could use one wait handle, with a task count:</p>

<pre><code>int taskCount = 0;

// Launch a thread
Interlocked.Increment(ref taskCount);

// A thread terminates
if (Interlocked.Decrement(ref taskCount) == 0)
    doneEvent.Set();
</code></pre>
