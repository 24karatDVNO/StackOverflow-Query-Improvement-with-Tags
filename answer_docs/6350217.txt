<p>In Windows the standard console windows provide up-arrow input history -- you don't have to do anything. For other standard Windows console services see the <code>doskey</code> command quickhelp, and simply replace the word "command" with "line of input". It's a bit misleading, yes.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>, added para: Possibly you're doing something that circumvents the standard services. I just noticed that the browser window title says "ncurses", which is not in your current question title. Perhaps that's it, but in that case, ask specifically for help with ncurses.</p>

<p>For *nix see the other answers.</p>
