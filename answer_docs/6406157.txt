<p>I end up doing this task as below:</p>

<ol>
<li>On successful completion of every page, save the page Name in database </li>
<li>When user request for a new page, simply check the page they have completed last from database and decide what to do.</li>
</ol>

<p>I chooses this approach simply because it will definitely <strong>help during Problem Solving/Troubleshooting once application is in Production</strong>, which is huge for me.</p>

<p>Thanks everyone for your responses!</p>
