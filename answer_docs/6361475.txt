<p>I use a many-to-many table that holds a relationship between the user and the ID of the entities they are allowed to modify. Every time anyone attempts to change one of those entities, I do a check to make sure that they are allowed to do it. I also put a trigger on the table that holds the entities that will delete associated records in that many-to-many table whenever an entity is deleted. This has worked out quite well for me.</p>

<p>Another thing you could do is use a Guid instead of an int for your primary key. That will prevent people from guessing the primary key.</p>
