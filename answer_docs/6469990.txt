<p>You can embed web browser control in WinForm and return value from SomeFunction 
into some DOM element, then you can access that element from WinForm.WebBrowser1.</p>

<p>There are also javascript emulators available, I think you can even use JSCRIPT dll from c#
but that may not work if SomeFunction() depends on DOM. </p>
