<p>Nulls are your problem.  Can you make a refactoring to push nulls away?</p>

<p>For example, you could refactor your code to make <code>item.getSuperCategories</code> never return null?  Or do you need to distinguish between the empty set and null?</p>

<p>Similarly, why are you passing null into this method?  If you can eliminate that scenario then the code just becomes a one liner.</p>
