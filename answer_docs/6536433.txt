<p>I use MongoDB in an app with the Mongoid ruby adapter.  Ryan Bates (the demigod of Rails) recently made an outstanding railscast on this very issue <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch" rel="nofollow">http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch</a>.</p>

<p>I'm using this in a MongoDB app and it works perfectly for encrypting data.  His tutorial video is mostly for encrypting passwords, but you can adapt it to any other field value you want.</p>

<p>I also have used attr_encrypted with much success but I'm not sure if it will work with MongoDB; only used it with ActiveRecord.</p>
