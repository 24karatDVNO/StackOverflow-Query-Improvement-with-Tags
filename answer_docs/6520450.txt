<p>you can use Fql query or Graph API to get your friends data.
Sometimes  you will not get all information from the graph like birthdate of your friends but yes you can use fql queries to solve your probs.</p>

<p>here is an exmple for you.</p>

<p>create first facbook object and the use it.</p>

<p>$query = "SELECT uid, first_name, last_name, birthday_date, sex, pic_square, current_location, hometown_location FROM user WHERE uid IN (SELECT uid2 FROM friend WHERE uid1 = me()) AND birthday_date != 0 ORDER BY birthday_date";</p>
