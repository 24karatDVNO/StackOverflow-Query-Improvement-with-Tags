<p>If you're at the point of complaining about a 1/1,000,000th of a second outage, then I suggest the following approach:</p>

<p>Front end load balancers pointing to multiple backend servers.</p>

<p>Remove one backend server from the loadbalancer to ensure no traffic will go to it.</p>

<p>Wait for all traffic that the server was processing has been sent.</p>

<p>Shutdown the webserver on that instance.</p>

<p>Update the django instance on that machine.</p>

<p>Add that instance back to the load balancers.</p>

<p>Repeat for every other server.</p>

<p>This will ensure that the 1/1,000,000th of a second gap is removed.</p>
