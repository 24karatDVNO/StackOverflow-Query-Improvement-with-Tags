<p>Switch your grid component to something that can double buffer and multithread (I expect most data will remain static around updates), or roll your own. Rolling your own sounds unavoidable: this kind of heavy update activity isn't the most common use case for grid controls. I'd start looking for grid controls with open source code you can modify, at e.g. <a href="http://www.codeproject.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com</a> or <a href="http://www.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeplex.com</a>. What to pick depends on your other requirements, alas.</p>
