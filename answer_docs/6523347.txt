<p>I assume you are missing a using statement in your extension class.</p>

<pre><code>using System.Web.Mvc.Html;
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>CheckBox</code> extension method is within that namespace. <code>HtmlHelper</code> itself is located in <code>System.Web.Mvc</code> which is probably used.</p>
