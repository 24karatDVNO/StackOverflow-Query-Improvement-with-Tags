<p>Go to the edit page area of the page you want to have single column. Under templates (in the right hand side bar) look for "single column" or "full width" page.</p>

<p>90% of themes have this. If yours does not, you would have to take page.php, download it. Duplicate it and rename it to fullwidth-page.php and reupload. Make sure the comment area at the top is right according to the "page template codex" in wordpress.org. Then, delete out wehre it calls the sidebar() code. Add a bit more inline CSS to the main content area to make the inline style width the full width then.</p>
