<p>You are putting the UI thread to sleep for a 1 second before returning. You should not put the UI thread to sleep. I believe you intended for your background thread to sleep for 1 second, if so then you'd need to do:</p>

<pre><code>void Tick()
{
    while (true)
    {
        textBlock1.Dispatcher.Invoke(
            DispatcherPriority.Normal,
            new Action(

      delegate()
      {
          textBlock1.Text = DateTime.Now.ToString("h:mm:ss");
      }
        ));

          // Executed on background thread, not UI thread
          Thread.Sleep(1000);
    }
}
</code></pre>
