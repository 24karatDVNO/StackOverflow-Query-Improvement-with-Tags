<p>As @SLaks stated, .Htaccess won't work.</p>

<p>Even if you did add <code>?1</code> on with htaccess, your browser would then cache that too.</p>

<p>If the JavaScript/Css file is cached there should be no problem with it as the browser would just load the cached files.</p>

<p>One way to get round it would be to do something like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="file.js?"&lt;php echo date("ymdhis");?&gt; /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>without the need for .Htaccess</p>
