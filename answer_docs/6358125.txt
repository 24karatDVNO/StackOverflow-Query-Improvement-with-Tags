<p>How about this:</p>

<pre><code>declare @InputDate datetime = '20110115';

with cCourseList as (

select  t1.School, t1.Course, DateStarted = t1.Date,
        t2.DateCompleted
from    tbl t1
outer apply 
        (select  top(1) DateCompleted = t2.Date
        from    tbl t2
        where   t2.Course = t1.Course
            and t2.Status = 'C'
        order by t2.Date) t2
where   t1.Status = 'S'

)

select  cl.School, 
        [Not Completed] = sum(case when cl.DateCompleted is null then 1 else 0 end)
from    cCourseList cl
where   cl.DateStarted &lt;= @InputDate
group by cl.School;
</code></pre>
