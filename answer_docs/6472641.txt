<p>There are currently two Python languages out there</p>

<ul>
<li>the original one, which is still being updated (currently at 2.7.2)</li>
<li>the overhauled Python 3, which is breaking compatibility (currently at 3.1.4)</li>
</ul>

<p>Many libraries have not switched to Python 3 yet, and might not for some time, so you're better off getting 2.6 or 2.7.</p>

<p>For Windows or Mac, I can recommend the <a href="http://www.enthought.com/products/edudownload.php" rel="nofollow">Enthought distribution</a> (free for academic use), which contains loads of goodies, including <a href="http://www.scipy.org/" rel="nofollow">scipy</a>, which you'll very probably need -- and installs hassle-free!</p>
