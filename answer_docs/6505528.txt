<p>If you change css properties after your page loads, such flickering will occur. The best way to be make the css have the same properties which the javascript manipulates it into. In that way you also make your page more efficient by skipping extra reflow/repaints in the browser. However a hack is to have have the javascript minimized and load it before your css load line.</p>
