<p>I've been successful with automating EXTJS sites and auto-generated ids, though I do not recommend it.  (because the ids are autogenerated, if new elements are added to the page, all your locators are potentially invalid.)</p>

<p>I'd recommend pin-pointing the precise item, instead of a full path</p>

<pre><code>//*[@id="ext-js123"]
</code></pre>
