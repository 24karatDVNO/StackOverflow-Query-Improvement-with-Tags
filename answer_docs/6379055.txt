<p>This works with EMFs pasted from Excel:</p>

<pre><code>  Dim oSh as Shape
  Set oSh = ActiveWindow.Selection.ShapeRange(1)
  ' Note:  ShapeRange(1), not just ShapeRange
  '  That's the problem with your second example

  With oSh
     .CropLeft = 10
     ' etc
  End With
</code></pre>

<p>The fact that it's yelling about an activex object in the first example makes me wonder whether the first shape is really an EMF, which would not be an ActiveX object.</p>
