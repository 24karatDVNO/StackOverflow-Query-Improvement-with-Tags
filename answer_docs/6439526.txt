<p>It depends on what you want to do...<br>
If you can use a json library such as Google Gson, it's perfect to manage JSON from Java.
then if you want to code it by yourself and you just manage integers and strings, it's not very difficult...<br>
a Json structure is just an array or a map key/value where key is a String and Value is either a simple value or a complex one hence a hashmap or an array...<br>
Anyway, generally, it's easier to use directly GSon ;)</p>
