<p>Basically a session is only viable for the period of time in which a user is interacting with your application + the session timeout that you specify. The usability of cookies is to store relevant information to the user so that, when they come back to the website again, you may identify them once more.</p>

<p>For instance, if you have both sensitive and insensitive information regarding a user, you could make your application more friendly by determining who they are via a cookie and loading all of the insensitive information. Once they authenticate themselves then you can load the sensitive information as well.</p>
