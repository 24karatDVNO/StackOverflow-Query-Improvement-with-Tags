<p>In 16-bit operating systems, int was 16-bit and long was 32-bit. After moving to Win32, both become 32 bit. Moving to 64 bit OS, it is a good idea to keep long size unchanged, this doesn't break existing code when it compiled in 64 bit. New types (like Microsoft-specific __int64, size_t etc.) may be used in 64 bit programs.</p>
