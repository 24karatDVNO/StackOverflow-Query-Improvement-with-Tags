<p>I've seen some code around to subclass UIGestureRecognizer to define a "check" gesture. It recognizes touch beginning, moving southeast, then moving northeast to draw a checkmark. Perhaps you could define letter shapes as specific gesture recognizers and then attached your whole alphabet of recognizers to a view and see what you get.</p>
