<p>I had this with using ruby installed via rvm. </p>

<p>This was invaluable and is the correct way I think.</p>

<p>I re-signed my rvm/ruby binary and all's well.</p>

<p>Relevant bits:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can examine the signature information by doing the following:</p>
  
  <p>codesign -dvvvv /path/to/application</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Then create a self-signed certificate via the Keychains application that is for Code Signing (see link for details). 
Then:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Re-signing the application is quite simple.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li>Open Terminal.</li>
  <li>Type "codesign -f -s (name of certificate) /path/to/application</li>
  </ol>
