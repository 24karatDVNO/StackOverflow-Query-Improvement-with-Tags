<p>You may be able to click a button on the form with the User32 dll if you know the forms handle.</p>

<p>In order to work out whether the screen has opened / closed you could create a windows hook that fires when a screen opens or closes. You will need to have a C++ library to do this as its not possible in c#, but you only need to create a small C++ assembly then reference it from your c#. You can check the title of a window when it opens to see if its the window you want, then you can get the window handle and see when it closes.</p>

<p>Some information on how to implement hooks can be found here.</p>

<p>The C++ assembly I used once is called GlobalCBTHook.</p>

<p>Here is another link from code project that shows global window hooks</p>
