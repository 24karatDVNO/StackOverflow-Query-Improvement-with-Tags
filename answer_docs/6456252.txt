<p>I did a couple of changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>I added a <code>chomp</code> to remove the <code>\n</code> character at the end of each line. It might not make any difference, but it could. Remember when you read in input, it might contain the <code>\n</code> character on the end.</li>
<li>I added a <code>$code++;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the nice things about Perl is that it's pretty smart about auto-incrementing things. You try to auto-increment something with letters in it, and Perl assumes you want to update it alphabetically.</p>

<p>Thus, I simply set <code>$n_code</code> and <code>$p_code</code> to "a", and let Perl handle the incrementing.</p>

<p>You weren't very clear what you were looking for, so I hope this is what you meant.</p>

<p>Next time, include some sample input and output. A half dozen lines of each would have been very helpful.</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/local/bin/perl

use warnings;    
use strict;

my $inputfile = "file1.txt"; 

open FH,$inputfile;          
my @results = &lt;FH&gt;;   
close FH;           

print "\n---------type n--------------\n" ;

my $n_code = "$a";
foreach my $line (@results) {
    chomp $line;  # Remove possible NL
    if ($line =~ m/(^Mgn\d\.qna.*)/i)            
    {
        print "$1 $n_code\n";
        $n_code++;   #Increment code to next alphabet character
    }    
}

print "\n---------type p--------------\n" ;

my $p_code = a;
foreach my $line (@results) {
   chomp $line;   #Remove possible NL
   if ($line =~ m/(^Mgp\d\.qpa.*)/i)     
       print "$1 $p_code\n";
       $p_code++;    #Increment code to next letter of alphabet
   }
}
