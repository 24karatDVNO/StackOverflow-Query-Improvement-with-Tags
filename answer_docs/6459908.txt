<p>That's right. If you don't understand that, you don't understand how a table view works. The cells are created on demand and reused; the same cell might be reused again and again for different rows of the table as the user scrolls. That means that you must prepare <em>all</em> the data <em>beforehand</em>, and simply fetch it on demand for any section/row requested.</p>

<p>To put it another way, MVC: model-view-controller. Your model is your data. <code>tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:</code> is view; you must not modify the model during this, because when and how often it is called depends entirely on the needs of the view.</p>

<p>Another thing is that you should not be making a separate array of image views. An image view is view. If you want to store a list of something, store a list of the names of the images or something.</p>
