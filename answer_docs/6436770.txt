<p><i>The default implementation of Equals supports reference equality only, but derived classes can override this method to support value equality.</p>

<p>For reference types, equality is defined as object equality; that is, whether the references refer to the same object. For value types, equality is defined as bitwise equality. The ValueType class supports value types.</i></p>

<p>So for reference types, unless they override <code>Equals</code>, the reference is compared - i.e. "does this refer to the same object".  For value types, the entire value is compared.</p>
