<p>Maybe use <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#setTag%28int,%20java.lang.Object%29" rel="nofollow"><code>setTag()</code></a> with a unique hashcode/int or something else? I can't really understand your question more than that. </p>

<p>From the docs:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sets a tag associated with this view and a key. A tag can be used to mark a view in its hierarchy and does not have to be unique within the hierarchy. Tags can also be used to store data within a view without resorting to another data structure. The specified key should be an id declared in the resources of the application to ensure it is unique (see the ID resource type).</p>
