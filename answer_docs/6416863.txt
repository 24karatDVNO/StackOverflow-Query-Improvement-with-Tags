<p>All browsers handle scroll-bars differently as you've learned.  All different widths and some are already included in the element width even when they're not used where others are added to the element's width when they show up.</p>

<p>With the following jQuery plugin, <a href="http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/jScrollPane/jScrollPane.html" rel="nofollow"><strong>jScrollPane</strong></a>, you can customize the scroll-bars using CSS.  It's not a perfect solution since you'll lose any default scroll-bars.  But on the plus side, you'll have precise cross-browser control over your element widths.</p>
