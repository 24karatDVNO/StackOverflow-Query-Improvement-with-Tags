<p>First, verify if yolk isn't installed in <code>Version/2.7/site-packages</code>. If it is not then you need to tell pip which python version to install to:</p>

<pre><code>pip -E /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python yolk
</code></pre>

<p>If it is then it is a problem with you path settings, and need to change the <code>PATH</code> variable appropriately.</p>
