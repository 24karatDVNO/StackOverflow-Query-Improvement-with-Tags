<p>I have been plagued with RSI for 10 years.  I doubt there is a solution that I haven't tried. </p>

<p>I got as far as creating a blueprint for a working solution,  which goes as follows:</p>

<p>you create a grid. going horizontally you have the consonant phonemes.   going down you have the vowel phonemes. English uses probably close to 20 consonant sounds and 13 vowel sounds,  though some of these are dipthong/tripthong.</p>

<p>so, after weeding out ones which are too close to their neighbour, you are left with at least 100 distinct phoneme pairs.</p>

<p>you then adapt Sphinx using ONLY these 10+10 phonemes,  and 100 word dictionary</p>

<p>and map a different keyboard character to each slot.</p>

<p>this will leave a lot of slots left over which you can customise.</p>

<p>then you speak to your computer using a sequence of nonsense 'la-lu-be-ni-pa-ta-bu-rru...'  and it types as you go</p>

<p>you could conceivably rack up a huge speed dictating this way, very possibly faster than a trained typist, bearing in mind you use all those crazy symbols when you code.</p>

<p>That's a big project. Maybe one day I will have a crack at it if no one else does.</p>

<p>I christened the project 'spascii' (ala 'speak ASCII') but I never started coding it.</p>

<p>second thing to bear in mind is that programmers use the mouse a lot.  I used to use a head pointer device called trackIR ( it used infrared ) and that was really decent. I later improved by pulling apart a gyroscopic mouse sticking the gyroscopes on a cap.   This gave really decent performance. I was clicking using a guitar footpedal wired into the mouse buttons, but in theory you could just assign one phoneme pair for left click,  left down,  left up, etc</p>
