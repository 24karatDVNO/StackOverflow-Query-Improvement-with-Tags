<p>You can scrape the page and pull the contents of the  tag to get the title. You should use an HTML parser to do this.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly sure how to get the name of the website. Can you just use the URL and format it cleanly? You could just take off the TLD and any subdomains and uppercase the first character. For example:</p>

<pre><code>stackoverflow.com -&gt; Stackoverflow
en.wikipedia.org -&gt; Wikipedia
</code></pre>

<p>This obviously isn't a perfect solution, but it might be good enough for your use case.</p>
