<p>No,</p>

<p>you can easily install the CDT features in a Java version of eclipse, or vice-versa, but I would add C++ to Java.</p>

<p>Once the features are installed the C++ projects can be opened and it is indistinguishable from the prepackaged version.</p>

<p>There is no magic there.</p>

<p>Help --> Install New Software --> Select helios repository (with a version indicator)</p>

<p>wait till the package list appears</p>

<p>Open the Programming Languages folder and select the CDT packages.</p>

<p>Typically eclipse complains so;e dependencies are missing, so select those too and it'll install.</p>
