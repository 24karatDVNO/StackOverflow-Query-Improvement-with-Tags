<p>I was so narrow minded in my looking for a solution above - trying to tie the removeClass with the form submit (which had to many actions tied into it and would have been overly complicated).</p>

<p>Instead, I just did a remove class at the beginning of the error checking:</p>

<pre><code>$("li").removeClass("alertRed");
$("input").removeClass("CO_form_alert");  
$("select").removeClass("CO_form_alert"); 
</code></pre>
