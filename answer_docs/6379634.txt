<p>This sounds reasonable enough a suggestion to me.</p>

<p>There shouldn't be any harm in implementing simple views to make querying vs. specific tables easier, e.g. (please forgive the syntax if not quite right - and by all means use column names rather then <code>*</code>s!).</p>

<pre><code>CREATE VIEW vw_Customers

AS

SELECT BT.*, C.*
FROM yourbasetable BT
INNER JOIN customers C
ON C.customerid = BT.ID
</code></pre>
