<p>You can use the Remote System Explorer (RSE) framework provided under the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/tm/" rel="nofollow">Target Management</a> project of Eclipse for accessing a remote or local machine from a shell.</p>

<p>Although the name might suggest that it might not be useful to run local commands, it is very well possible to do so. If you have to connect to remote systems from Eclipse, then it would be the suitable plug-in to use.</p>
