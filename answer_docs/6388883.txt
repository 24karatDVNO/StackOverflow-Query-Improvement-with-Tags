<p>I'm not sure how your text files are formatted, but you can use StreamReader to load and read through the lines of the text.  First, do that to A, add each line to an array, and then filter through the array for each line of B to see if there is a match.  If so, remove that line from B before creating C with StreamWriter.</p>
