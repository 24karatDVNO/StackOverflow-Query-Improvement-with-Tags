<p>Sorry, I was using an old version of the code to debug the application, where the line</p>

<pre><code>m_wordDoc.PrintOut(ref ...);
</code></pre>

<p>was not wrapped in an <code>else</code> block. Once I debugged the correct version of my code, the print dialog behaved as expected.</p>

<p>Sorry to interrupt ...</p>
