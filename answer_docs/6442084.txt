<p>This is not possible, since the CSS apply to the entire page. To achieve what you want, you should divide your page into different sections, by giving a unique ID to each section for example. This way you can apply separate styles to separate sections of your page.</p>

<p>For example your navigation div could have <code>id="navigation-bar"</code>, then in the CSS you will write:</p>

<pre><code>#navigation-bar {

  /* styles here will apply only to navigation-bar and elements inside it */

}
</code></pre>

<p>And so on...</p>
