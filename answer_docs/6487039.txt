<p>I found the answer. 
Let me share with you. I dont know if there is a better approach.</p>

<p>First, I tried to parse data inside table with:</p>

<pre><code>String line = null;
HtmlELementCollection elems = webBrowser1.Document.GetElementByTagName("tbody");
foreach (HtmlElement row in elems)
{
line +=row.InnerHtml;
}
</code></pre>

<p>After that I decided to use Regex to parse the exact data from String line 
With MatchCollection I parsed the data I want.</p>

<p>I am not writing that part but if anybody needs more information I can help.</p>

<p>I hope it will be helpful. At least it worked for me :)</p>
