<p>I don't know anything about GNUstep, but <a href="http://www.gnustep.org/resources/documentation/make_1.html#SEC16" rel="nofollow">the documentation</a> seems to indicate that you should use <code>triangular_CFLAGS</code> (without the underscore between C and FLAGS).  </p>

<p>Besides, I know even less about ObjC, but I'm wondering if you shouldn't use <code>triangular_OBJCFLAGS</code> instead?</p>
