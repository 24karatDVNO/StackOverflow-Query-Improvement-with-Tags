<p>I have found in the past that putting () after ScriptService in the attribute declared on the web service class has <em>seemingly</em> solved certain bizarre problems.  No idea why it might have worked but worth a try in your case too.</p>

<p>i.e.</p>

<pre><code>[WebService(Namespace = "http://localhost:2900/")]
[WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]
[ScriptService()]
public class WebServices1 : WebService
{
    [WebMethod]
    public string PieTable(string table)
    {
        return table + " - resultant text";
    }
}
</code></pre>
