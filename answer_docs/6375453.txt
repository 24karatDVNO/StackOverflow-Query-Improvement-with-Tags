<p>Sure, you can do replication on a single MySQL server. But I think you may like to have a look at the FEDERATED storage engine - <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/federated-storage-engine.html" rel="nofollow">http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/federated-storage-engine.html</a>.</p>

<p>A word of caution though that FEDERATED tables have their own limitations and I think they do not perform very well with very busy tables. So, you'll need to burn some hours to research on federated tables and see if they work for your setup.</p>
