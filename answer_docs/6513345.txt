<p>The direct answer for your question is: Page_Load event will load before your Javascript background calls. I recommend using javascript with background loading when your page has several web controls that load too much data, draw elements or doing heavy calculations that take much time and affect the user experience and application performance. You need to give the user the ability to load the page and seeing the progress of each element loading (so that he don't get bored while browsing). REST calls with JSON is recommended for this case.</p>
