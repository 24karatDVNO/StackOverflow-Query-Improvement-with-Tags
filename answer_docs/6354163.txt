<p>I would say that you could use an intermediary service (such as a php script etc) and send your data in the form of a URL page request for it to store the data on the webpage.
for example if you would like to create a new record on the URL.
you could then send <a href="http://myhost.com/update.php?name=xyz?value=23" rel="nofollow">http://myhost.com/update.php?name=xyz?value=23</a> or something like that I assume.</p>

<p>I would say that making your android manipulate a static webpage( if thats what you are trying to do ) is rather a overhead and unnecessary.</p>
