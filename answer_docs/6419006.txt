<p>It is always a good idea to do some design before beginning to code, whatever the size of the project. You may not need to create diagrams for all parts of the application but the exercise of creating these diagrams for the critical/complex parts will most probably clarify your understanding of the problem and save time over the development cycle. Class diagrams and sequence diagrams are the ones that I have seen being used most often.</p>
