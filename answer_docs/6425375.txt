<p>SOA is just a set of architecture principles and none of these principles is restricting or encouraging throughtput and performance. You can say designing for SOA (loose coupling, autonomy, governance, ...) and designing for performance are two independent aspects.</p>

<p>Many vendors claim that they have "SOA" products but in reality you can build SOA on any platform but no product can ensure you are building a proper SOA. Just select the product or vendor that suits best your business requirements and set up the right organizational structure to ensure you are building according to SOA principles.</p>

<p>Back to your scenario, if you've really large volumes (millions of records per hour), ETL products or custom software are the best. MDM is more geared for data consolidation than integration. If you've 10-100 thousands of records per hour, you can use integration products (from TIBCO, IBM, Oracle, Software AG, Progress or open source ones) with added benefits.</p>
