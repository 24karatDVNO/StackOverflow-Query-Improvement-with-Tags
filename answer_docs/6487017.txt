<p>Which says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The JFrame class is slightly
  incompatible with Frame. Like all
  other JFC/Swing top-level containers,
  a JFrame contains a JRootPane as its
  only child. The content pane provided
  by the root pane should, as a rule,
  contain all the non-menu components
  displayed by the JFrame. This is
  different from the AWT Frame case. For
  example, to add a child to an AWT
  frame you'd write:</p>

<pre><code>   frame.add(child);   
</code></pre>
  
  <p>However using JFrame you need to add the child
  to the JFrame's content pane instead:</p>

<pre><code>   frame.getContentPane().add(child);  
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The same is true for setting layout
  managers, removing components, listing
  children, and so on. All these methods
  should normally be sent to the content
  pane instead of the JFrame itself. The
  content pane will always be non-null.
  Attempting to set it to null will
  cause the JFrame to throw an
  exception. The default content pane
  will have a BorderLayout manager set
  on it.</p>
