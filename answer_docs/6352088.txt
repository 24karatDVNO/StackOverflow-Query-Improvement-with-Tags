<p>Your question is very vague in fact, so I will only suggest a few points to start reading from, that I believe are important.</p>

<p>I think that you will answer any other questions you may have by reading through the developer documents for Android and studying the supplied examples. But don't hesitate to ask another, more specific question if you run into trouble.</p>

<p>tl;dr</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/fundamentals/activities.html" rel="nofollow">Activities</a> (must read!)</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html" rel="nofollow">Dialogs</a> (you will need these)</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html" rel="nofollow">Data Storage</a> (also important for the app you describe)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're still lost, just get some sample code from the repository and toy with it.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
