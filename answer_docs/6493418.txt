<p>You can create your own form however you like. That really does not have any connection to the API.</p>

<p>In order to manipulate Google Calendar from your own site you will have to use the Google Calendar Data API.
The official guide to it is here:  <a href="http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide.html" rel="nofollow">http://code.google.com/apis/calendar/data/2.0/developers_guide.html</a></p>

<p>If you want to use PHP I would highly recommend using the Zend Framework, since it makes using the API a lot easier.</p>

<p>Zend has the functionality to deal with the Google Calendar API.</p>
