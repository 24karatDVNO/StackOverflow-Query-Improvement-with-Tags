<p>I think there is no longer history available. See amongst other google hits <a href="http://blog.programmableweb.com/2010/08/12/twitter-search-history-dwindling-now-at-four-days/" rel="nofollow">this link</a>. It might be an oldy, but the concept stands: there is no longer search history then a couple of days, not exactly specified by twitter as far as I know.</p>
