<p>I would suggest you switch to <a href="http://www.mpdf1.com/mpdf/" rel="nofollow">mPDF</a>! It is a little bit slower than <a href="http://html2fpdf.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">HTML2PDF</a>, but it handles almost all Unicode languages, and has many more <a href="http://www.mpdf1.com/mpdf/enhancements" rel="nofollow">features</a> bundled with it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mPDF is a PHP class which generates
  PDF files from UTF-8 encoded HTML. It
  is based on <a href="http://www.fpdf.org/" rel="nofollow">FPDF</a> and
  <a href="http://html2fpdf.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">HTML2FPDF</a>, with a number of
  enhancements.</p>
