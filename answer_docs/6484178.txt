<p>Without knowing more about your application - I think you should just start with storing <code>NSDate</code>s.</p>

<p>You're rounding things up in large increments, so it seems unlikely that you are generating/storing dates at volumes where it's going to make too much difference.</p>

<p>Best practice is to not complicate things, and not optimise before you've profiled the application.</p>
