<p>Quick idea:</p>

<p>Set the vertical <code>LinearLayout</code>'s height to 0dp, and use <code>weight</code> to give it the rest of all the remaining space after your other view is laid out, e.g. give it <code>android:layout_weight="1"</code></p>

<p>The tricky part is needing to set the height to 0 so it actually uses the <code>layout_weight</code>.</p>
