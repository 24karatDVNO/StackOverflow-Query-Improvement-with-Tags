<p>I don't believe there is a way to do this.   The dependency list is buried in the registry as a list of null-delimited strings referring to a local service name.  The local service names are only allowed to point to local service EXEs or DLLs so I'm pretty sure this is not possible using the service-dependency framework in the service manager.</p>
