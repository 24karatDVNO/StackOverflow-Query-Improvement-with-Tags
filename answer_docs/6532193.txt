<p>If you are getting the right vol then it means you are initialising the struct at least partially correctly. Check to ensure the HWND you copied is the same as the actual one. If you are making a modeless dialog box then the return is the HWND. If you are making a modal one then you can pass in a pointer to the struct with DialogBoxParam() which you can then initialise in WM_INITDIALOG.</p>
