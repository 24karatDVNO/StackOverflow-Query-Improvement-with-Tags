<p>I would give SASS a shot ;)
<a href="http://sass-lang.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sass-lang.com/</a></p>

<pre><code>#elementA, #elementB{
  a.blah {
    ..
  }

  label {
    ..
  }

  div.some_class {
    ..
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sass is really quite amazing, both for it's mixin capability and for it's awesome nesting.  However as some people mentioned previously, it could make the most sense to just use a class named <code>.element</code></p>

<p>But I refuse to work on any project without using Sass :p  It's so easy to setup for any static or dynamic site.</p>
