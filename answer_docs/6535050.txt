<p>I could be wrong, but i think it is just the "simulator" that can not invite particular friends to play. </p>

<p>I have been able to use 2 or more iPhones running in the sandbox to invite particular friends to play, and it has worked wonderfully for debugging the invite handler piece of code.</p>

<h2>As another poster mentioned, there does not appear to be at this time a way of inviting particular friends to play a particular game from Game Center.</h2>

<p>Happy gaming!</p>
