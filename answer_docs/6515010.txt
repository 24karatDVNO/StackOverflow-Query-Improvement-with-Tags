<p>You have a couple of options. One is <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Beaker" rel="nofollow">beaker</a>. It's a WSGI middleware designed to do caching and session storage. Not sure how it integrates with a regular CGI app, but shouldn't be too difficult. This would close to PHP's <code>session_start()</code> and storing things in <code>$_SESSION</code>. Beaker has a number of ways to store session information (cookie with session data, cooking with session id, etc etc)</p>

<p>The other way I can think of would be to have a hidden <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> element with the original numbers. This would be submitted with the form, and available in <code>form</code>. To be honest, this is a bad way to do things. It's open to a user attack and therefore is not secure. I know this is just a test application, but might as well start off on the right foot :)</p>
