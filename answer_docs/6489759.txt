<p>Found the error
MonoDroid seems to have a problem, when an imageview has it's layoutheight set to "wrap-content".
I changed the layoutheight, just for testing, to 95dp and it worked perfectly. 
So for everyone encountering layout problems with Monodroid: Try setting layoutwidth/-height to a constant value.</p>

<p>I can not say, if this error also occurs on a real device.</p>

<p>Hope this can help someone</p>
