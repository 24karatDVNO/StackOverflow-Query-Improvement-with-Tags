<p>Create a static field in your Activity and check the current orientation in <code>onCreate()</code> using <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Configuration.html" rel="nofollow">Configuration</a>. If the field is empty, store the configuration, if it's not, check for changes, take the necessary actions and store the new configuration afterwards.</p>
