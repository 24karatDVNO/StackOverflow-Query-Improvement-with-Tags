<p>Even though this question is a bit older already, I would suggest the following compromise:<br>
Just use max-width: 200px; and min-width: 300%; or so,<br>
whereas the min-width could result higher than the max-width.<br>
Just figure it out.<br>
This way you could not have entirely liquid tooltips but the width would stand in kind of a correlation with the width of the containing link element.<br>
In terms of optical pleasantness this approach could be of value.  </p>

<p><em>edit</em>:<br>
Well I must admit it is nonsense what I wrote. When the min-width can be higher than the max-width, there is no sense to it.
So just putting the min-width in percent would achieve what I tried to suggest.
Sorry for that.</p>
