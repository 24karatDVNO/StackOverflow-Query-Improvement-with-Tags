<p>Working with what Chris suggested, you could use the <code>which</code> command. According to the <a href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?which" rel="nofollow">man</a> page, <code>which</code> reports the full path of the executable that would have been executed if its argument had been entered at the shell prompt. Since we know $0 was entered at the shell prompt, we can use `which $0` to report exactly the path that was used to execute. Unfortunately, this still suffers from the symlink issue, as which does not provide options to avoid symlinks.</p>
