<p>You probably mean PDB files, not DMP files.</p>

<p>PDB files contain the full debug information of an application.  I suggest to turn on PDB files for release version of your executable.  If your application crashes at the customer, you can use the MiniDump file (yes, that's the DMP file) to look up the cause of the problem by using your PDB file.</p>
