<p>This isn't really a supported activity. I too have been thinking about what to do when you want a desktop version with extended features and you want the two to share data.</p>

<p>I think the key here is to think about how Microsoft achieves this with email and calendaring. There's no shared filesystem, rather Outlook on the desktop and Outlook on the phone both function as clients for the same Exchange server.</p>

<p>At one point I considered running a webservice in a desktop app so that the phone app could push data to the desktop app, but that would be a very manual process. The common-server model will provide a much better UX.</p>
