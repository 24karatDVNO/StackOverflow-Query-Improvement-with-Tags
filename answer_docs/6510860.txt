<p>Create a intermediate set and check against it:</p>

<pre><code># create set to check against
seconds = set(x[1] for x in list_of_lists)

# remove matching keys
for k in my_dict.keys():
  if k not in seconds:
     delete my_dict[k]
</code></pre>

<p>Easy. Runs in O(N) time, with O(N) storage.
Note that in your example, the capitalization will not match ('roger' != 'Roger')</p>
