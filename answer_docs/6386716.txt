<p>I can offer a way to know if the user clicked on a browser button (back, forward, closing browser, etc...). I couldn't find any way to figure out which button was clicked,
But I hope it will help you.</p>

<p>To know if the user clicked on a browser button, follow these steps:
1. Register window.beforeunload event.
2. In the handler, check event.clientY.
3. If event.clientY is not defiend or event.clientY&lt;0, then you know the user clicked a browser button.</p>

<p>For example: <br/>
(You probably will have to change the code to fit it to your problem)</p>

<pre>
function beforeUnloadHandler(eventArg)
{
   var _e = window.event || eventArg;

   // browser button click
   if (isNaN(_e.clientY) || _e.clientY &lt; 0) 
   {
       // unload process will continue
       // and unload event will be fired
       return;
   }

   // a confirmation with 'test alert' text will appear
   // if the user clicks 'Cancel', the unload process will stop 
   // and unload event won't be fired.
   return "test alert";
}
window.onbeforeunload = beforeUnloadHandler;
</pre>

<p>This code will work in all major browsers: chrome, ff, ie9,ie8,ie7,ie6, opera 11, opera 10, safari 3,4,5.</p>
