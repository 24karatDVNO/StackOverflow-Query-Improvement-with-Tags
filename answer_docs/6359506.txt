<p>IMHO it might be useful to store their department information in a table (either extend <code>sf_guard_user</code>, or make another for such "extended userdata", and check if it's set there. </p>

<p>If not, they haven't answered this yet, and thus are here the first time; consider giving the user an option "don't want to choose", different from "not chosen yet" - depending on your business logic, you may want this or not.</p>
