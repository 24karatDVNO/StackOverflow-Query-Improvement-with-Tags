<p>Google Appengine would be much easier for you in terms of getting a web application available and up on the web. You might want to look at the way it stores data (Appengine's datastore) as it maybe different than how you would store things in a RDBMS.</p>

<p>You could use the gdata-python-client with Appengine. Please refer to "Using the gdata-python-client" library <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/python/retrieving_gdata_feeds.html" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
