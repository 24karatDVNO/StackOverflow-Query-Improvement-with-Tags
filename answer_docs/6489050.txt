<p>There is no COUNT DISTINCT in Access, try using a subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT ade.Office, Count(*) as DomainsCount FROM 
(SELECT DISTINCT Office, Domain FROM [AD Employees]) ade
GROUP BY ade.Office
</code></pre>

<p>(written quickly, might require fine tuning)<br>
Note that if you save that query and then edit it in SQL view, Access has a strange behaviour, changing parentheses into squera brackets, and forcing you to re-edit the parentheses around the subquery before saving.</p>
