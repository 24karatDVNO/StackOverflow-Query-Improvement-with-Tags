<p>I found out that in the input field (in above example), i had put float:left;, which was causing the problem. If anyone is interested, here you can see example. If you remove <code>float:left;</code>, it will work fine. <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/CmXrX/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/CmXrX/1/</a></p>
