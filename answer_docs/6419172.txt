<p>You are allocating p1 on the stack, as a local variable, and then returning a pointer to it.  It will subsequently be wiped out during or after function return as the memory gets reused.  Try returning p1 instead and have the function return the pin_ptr, because when the pin_ptr goes out of scope the memory gets unpinned anyway.</p>

<p>A similar scenario would be this:</p>

<pre><code>int* foo()
{
    int x = 2;
    return &amp;x;
}
</code></pre>
