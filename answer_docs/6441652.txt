<blockquote>
  <p>1) create a wrapper class for main web
  service calls and calls the
  third/error handling webservice from
  that web service calls.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That sounds much better.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) create a wrapper for error handling
  routines and move all the routines to
  that class., whcih includes call to
  error/third reporting webservice.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Consolidating logging into a reusable object is the right way to go, but I wouldn't hard-code it to something like a web service.</p>

<p>What happens if the web services fail due to network issues - your logging call will fail also (if I understand your design).</p>
