<p>As mentioned by Raul, you need to provide more info for us to help out. You could try any of these things:</p>

<ul>
<li>See if you can reproduce this issue within a simple html file, that doesn't have any of the extra stuff that your current page may have. If the issue still persists, put it into jsFiddle and post the link here.</li>
<li>If you haven't already, install the <a href="http://getfirebug.com" rel="nofollow">Firebug</a> addon for Firefox, and use it's console to check for any JS errors.</li>
<li>Have a look at the <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/7GRcL" rel="nofollow">jsFiddle</a> that I've created. Is this similar to what you are doing? Mine works wihtout any issues.</li>
</ul>
