<p>Since the Group can be (by default) unstructured with respect to the filesystem, I think it is impractical to try and organize the file system, thus SVN.  The difficulty comes in the "policing" and enforcement of the violations during shared development.  If the IDE created the Group as a folder then I think more discussion would be merited.  Once you organize your project with functional Groups, you can ignore the command line of SVN, and view the elegance in the IDE.  It does make for a flat SVN structure (ugly) but that is invisible.</p>
