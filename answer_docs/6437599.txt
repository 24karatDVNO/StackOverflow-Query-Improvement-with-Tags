<p>I've got the solution:</p>

<pre><code>Select Month(B.NewDate) Mon, Year(B.NewDate) Year, Code, PK
from T1 A ,
(Select Max(Str_To_Date(Concat('01',',',Month,',',Year), '%d,%m,%Y')) as NewDate, Code C
from T1 group by Code) B
Where PK = (Select PK from T1
                where Year = Year(B.NewDate) and Month = Month(B.NewDate)  and Code = A.Code)
and A.Code = C
group by Code
</code></pre>
