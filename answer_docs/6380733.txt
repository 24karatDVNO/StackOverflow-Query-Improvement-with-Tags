<p>I believe an ACL is a set of mapping information for the relationships between Users and Permissions.
When an ACL is assoicated with a Security Object (List, DocLib, Site...), and when you try to visit the Security Object, SharePoint will look through the ACL to see if you are within the ACL and what Permissions you have. Then, SharePoint knows weather to show you the Security Object or not.</p>
