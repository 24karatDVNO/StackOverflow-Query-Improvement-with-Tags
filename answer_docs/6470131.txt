  <p>Can standard library provided by one compiler be compiled with other

<p>Assuming that the library is standards conforming, yes (I know this is kind of chicken-and-egg).</p>

  <p>When we say a particular compiler is standard conformant, does
  it automatically mean that the stdlib
  which comes with it is also
  standard-conformant? Or it simply
  means that this compiler can compile
  standard-conformant code written by
  us, programmers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, although I'm not aware of any fully confirming compiler. Note that standards conforming for us as programmers is <em>different</em> from the standard library. For example the implementation is allowed to use identifiers containing <code>__</code> (double underscore).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can I use standard library provided by one compiler, in my
  project which uses a different
  compiler to compile the project? Is
  portability same as
  standard-conformance?</p>

<p>You should be able to <em>compile</em> and use such a library. You almost certainly wouldn't be able to use any compiled library files (static or dynamic) file because name mangling would be different.</p>
