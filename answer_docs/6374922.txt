<p>You can take advantage of the fact that days of the week repeat every seven days. Here is a basic outline of an algorithm:</p>

<ol>
<li>Count the number of days worked in the first partial week.</li>
<li>Count the number of days worked in the last partial week.</li>
<li>Calculate the number of whole weeks in the middle and multiply by number of days worked in a week.</li>
<li>Sum the above three values.</li>
</ol>
