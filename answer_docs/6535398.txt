<p>Finally i did! 
I have to use 2 background workers.. this is what i did..
backgroundWorker1: performs the post method.
backgroundWorker2: performs a TimeSpan counter.
when backgroundWorker2 starts, sets a TimeSpan in 0 and in the DoWork, if the backgroundWorker1 CancellationPending is false, then i report progress in backgroundWorker2.
When the post method finish, i set backgroundWorker1 to CancelAsync, so the backgroundWorker2 will terminate to.
I think that was my best solution.</p>
