<p>I had the same issue, and was getting frustrated with the constant rebuilds. For me it was a fairly simple solution. I had just made a re-install of my computer and had found that I had set the date incorrectly. So this evening I changed the date back one day...</p>

<p>This resulted in me having files with a last changed timestamp on several files in my project one day in the 'future', and thus constant rebuilds. </p>
