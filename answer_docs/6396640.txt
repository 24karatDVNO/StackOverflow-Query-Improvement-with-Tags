<p>I think you need to use Bundle and static global variable and onActivityResult(). If you want to edit client with previous client to new client . Suppose you have "ClientList" Activity and "EditClient" Activity</p>

<p>Write into "EditClient" Activity</p>

<pre><code>Bundle extras = getIntent().getExtras();
  if (extras != null) 
  {
      String name = extras.getString(ClientList.KEY_Client);//ClientList.KEY_Client is global static variable of "ClientList" Activity.

      if (name != null) 
      {
          nameText.setText(name);//"nameText" is a EditText object represent EditText view
      }

  }
</code></pre>
