<p>Here's a "dictreader" for a headless csv, each row will be a dictionary with sequential keys 'column_0', 'column_1', 'column_2' and so on...</p>

<pre><code>import csv

csvfile = list(csv.reader(open('data.csv')))

csvdics = []

for row in csvfile:
    row_dict = {}
    for i in xrange(len(row)):
        row_dict['column_%s' % i] = row[i]
    csvdics.append(row_dict)
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if you know ahead of time what the column names should be, you can pass them in a list as a second argument to DictReader.</p>
