<p>Have you remembered to set the "InstallAllUsers" property in the setup project to true?  This is pretty much undocumented, and I have just spent the last three days banging my head against exactly the same problem you describe until I noticed that I had overlooked this.  Set it to "true" and now my project installas to all users :)</p>
