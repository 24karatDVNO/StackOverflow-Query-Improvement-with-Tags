<p>libcurl will POST the data you pass to it, with for example the <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_setopt.html#CURLOPTPOSTFIELDS" rel="nofollow">CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS</a> option. It does not distinguish between a char array and a pointer to data as long as you make sure you pass it on correctly.</p>
