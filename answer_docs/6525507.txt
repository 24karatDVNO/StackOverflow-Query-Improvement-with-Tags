<p>You can checkout my <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4743738/use-openoffice-uno-cli-with-c-to-create-a-spreadsheet">post</a> about how to create an OO Spreadsheet. The example is .NET but should be easily portable to Java. I haven't done it before but I would assume that you can replace <code>writer8</code> with <code>draw8</code> to access the OpenOffice Draw engine instead of the spreadsheet engine. If you have successfully created a Spreadsheet that way, then you can checkout the API about how to add Shapes and Figures.</p>
