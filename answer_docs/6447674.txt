<p>I was continually having a similar problem (SQLite.dll being locked by the Visual Studio test runner, although in Debug mode mostly and using MbUnit tests) and found that using TestDriven.net to run my tests solved the problem for me.  I never looked any further into the MSTest runner after this, sorry.</p>
