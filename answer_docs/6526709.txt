<p>I would check out <a href="http://www.veetle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.veetle.com</a>. It is all live steams and they do not have a pause button but rather an on and off button.</p>

<p>So to answer your question I would say to make it simple pause should stop/pause the playback and then when it is resumed start from where the live stream is. </p>

<p>On the other hand if you could pause the live stream and continue from the same time that would be really slick, a little confusing to build but slick</p>
