<p>I don't exactly know what you want. But definitely you cannot render other action with views as a part of the current action.</p>

<p>However, you could write private methods on the controller for setting up the variables and include the corresponding common partials in your view files.</p>

<p>This is an example:</p>

<pre><code>class UsersController &lt; ...
  def show
    @user = current_user

    setup_user_friends_widget(@user)
  end

  private

  def setup_user_friends_widget(for_who)
    @use_user_friends_widget= true

    @friends = for_who.friends
  end
end

# in your view users/show.html.erb

&lt;%- if @use_users_friend_widget %&gt;
  &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; "shared/widgets/user_friends"
&lt;%- end %&gt;

# in shared/widgets/_user_friends

&lt;%- @friends.each do |friend| %&gt;
  # use the instance variables directly because you have to call the setup_user_friends_widget method before you could use this widget.
  # so you are safe to use the instance variables instead of passing them from render :partial

  ...
%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In this way, you could extract those common-things out to private methods on controllers and those methods automatically have access to params, sessions, cookies if you need them.</p>
