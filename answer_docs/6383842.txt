<p>It seems there is an issue with the NPM registry at the moment - I was getting the same error, installed using git, and then discovered that the registry is down too.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues</a> for more about the registry being down - there could be an issue with the whole of NPM.</p>
