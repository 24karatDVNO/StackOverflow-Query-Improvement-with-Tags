<p>Sounds like you are going to recreate all the logic of a button, simply to remove the border/background. Remember every control in Silverlight is simply skinned and therefore  infinitely configurable. </p>

<p>You do want to use a normal button with an image, then restyle the button to remove the parts you don't want. I realise this seems daunting at first, but there are simplified basic skins available to simplify that task, or you can use Expression Blend (if you have access to it or can afford it).</p>
