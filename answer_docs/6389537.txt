<p>"Safefy" your code, like this</p>

<pre><code>str_replace( array("\r", "\r\n", "\n", "\t"), '', str_replace('"','\"',$str));
</code></pre>

<p>The above function clears linebreaks, and tabs so that your code appears in one line. If it breaks into more than one line, then it cannot be parsed as a string in JS and an error is thrown. Also we are escaping " to \",  maybe there are more string replacements that need to take place, it depends in your content.</p>

<p>and inline it in javascript, </p>

<pre><code>//&lt;![CDATA[ 
    var myHtml = &lt;?php echo '"'.$stuff.'"'; ?&gt;;
//]]&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>keep in mind the '"' part so that it appears like this var myHtml = "test";</p>
