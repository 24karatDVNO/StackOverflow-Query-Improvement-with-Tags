<p>There is no support for the <code>TextRange</code> in Silverlight. The closest you'll get is the <code>TextSelection</code> object which merely represents the range of text that the user has selected.  You can't manipulate the selection yourself, except by calling <code>SelectAll</code> on the <code>RichTextBox</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<p>If you just want to access the entire contents a RichTextBox as Xaml then you can use its <code>Xaml</code> property.</p>
