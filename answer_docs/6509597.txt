<p>Create a file named .htaccess in the directory where you want this behavior to occur. Inside the .htaccess file, put a single line beginning with DirectoryIndex followed by the list of filenames that you want Apache to serve first when a directory has been requested, like so:</p>

<pre><code>DirectoryIndex index.php index.html index.htm index.phtml start.html
</code></pre>

<p>The above directive must be all on a single line in the .htaccess file.</p>
