<p>There's several ways you can go with this, depending on the level of separation you want to achieve and how many concurrent tenants you want to support. At one extreme, you can create a new schema for each tenant and therefore ensure database-level isolation of data. For most practical purposes it's usually sufficient to have a logical partitioning of your data by assigning a <code>tenant_id</code> to every entity in your domain model and maintaining foreign-key constraints. Of course this means you'll probably want to always pass in your current session's <code>tenant_id</code> to every query / finder method so that it can restrict the data set based on that. You'll want to make sure that users cannot access another tenant's data by entering a tenant id (or a entity id) that does not belong to them in url.</p>
