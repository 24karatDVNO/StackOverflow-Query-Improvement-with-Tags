<p>I solved the my problem by devoting the time into this for "Registered Callback URL". used any url (not be present as the valid one) its totally depend on you.</p>

<p>"Registered Callback URL". examplelike...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://www.appname.com/done" rel="nofollow">http://www.appname.com/done</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>the only point is you enter the same "Registered Callback URL". value as you enter during the registration process.</p>

<p>Thanks EveryOne...</p>
