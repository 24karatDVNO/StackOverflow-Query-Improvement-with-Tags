<p>Completly false. Especially in this case.<br>
You are doing it the right way (DI). No need for changes here imo.</p>

  <p>I may have to move the vote casting in both Article &amp; Comment Service?</p>

<p>This could be another solution. But you can freely stay with this imo.<br>
If you want implement this solution you can create an interface <code>IVotable</code> with a method <code>addVote</code>.</p>

<p>At this point you can implements this interface in your <code>Articles/Comments</code> class so you could do:</p>

<pre><code>$a = new Article;
$b = new Comment;
$a-&gt;addVote($currentLoggedUser,10); //&gt; Inject only loggedUser (and maybe your DAL)
$b-&gt;addVote($currentLoggedUser,10);
</code></pre>
