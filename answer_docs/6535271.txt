<p>extensible-1.5.0-beta1 (<a href="https://github.com/bmoeskau/Extensible/downloads" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/bmoeskau/Extensible/downloads</a>) works with Ext JS 4. I have tried the basic calendar example and it is working fine (except for 1 or 2 missing images). However, you MUST place the extension directory as a sibling of the Ext JS directory (i.e. both these should be in one directory) and also, rename the Ext JS directory (which originally has the version attached to it) to just "extjs". This will fix everything!</p>
