<p>+1 for thehiatus.</p>

<p>The annotation stuff is really complicated. I tried to convert an editor to a <code>IViewPart</code> some time back... It took at long time to get it to work... well almost... almost, but quite like the real thing :-) (A bit like Swing and Microsoft Vista).</p>

<p>Also have a look at <code>TextEditor</code> and the the methods <code>createAnnotationAccess()</code> and <code>configureSourceViewerDecorationSupport(...)</code>.</p>
