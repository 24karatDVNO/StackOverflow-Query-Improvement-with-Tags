<p>The simplest solution is probably to first convert each numeral into a regular integer (in a new array), and then sort both arrays based on the integer array. Not sure if PHP contains a function for that, though. Alternatively, you can define a comparison function that converts two Roman numerals to integers and compares them. Writing a function that directly compares two Roman numerals without converting them to integers first will likely be cumbersome.</p>
