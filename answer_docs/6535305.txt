<p>To prevent an ugly error on timeout I suggest enclosing it and using a rescue like this:</p>

<pre><code>begin
   status = Timeout::timeout(5) do 
      #Some stuff that should be interrupted if it takes too long
   end       
rescue Timeout::Error
   puts "Error message: It took too long!\n"
end  
</code></pre>
