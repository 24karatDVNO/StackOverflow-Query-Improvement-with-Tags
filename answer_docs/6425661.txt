  <p>URL 1 doesnt have any extension like HTML or aspx. But it displays a page. Is is possible to know the exact name of the page being displayed? (it is not displayed in Browser)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The name of the page will be the text inside the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element (assuming an HTML document). There is no way to know the filename, or even if there is a file to begin with. URLs resolve to resources and how the HTTP server determines the resource is an implementation detail of the HTTP server and utterly irrelevant to the client.</p>

<p>(Anecdote time: A friend was unimpressed by his university spidering the contents of his HTTP server and ignoring the robots.txt directives, so he wrote a script to generate random HTML documents containing random links, and let it spend a couple of days indexing utter nonsense on random URLs where the resources were all generated by <code>random.py</code>. There was no way to know that <code>random.py</code> was called <code>random.py</code> from outside the server (or even that it existed, although it was relatively easy to infer)).</p>

<p>The exact URL <strong>is</strong> <code>http://www.techwyse.com/services/</code> (there might be other URLs that resolve to an identical resource, but that one is as written).</p>

  <p>What do we call these kind of URLs like URL2 ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>URLs. (If you really want to distinguish them you could say "URLs with something that appears to be a file name in them").</p>
