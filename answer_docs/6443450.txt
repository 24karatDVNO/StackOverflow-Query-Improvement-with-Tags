<p>I guess at this stage you are having two images. Left bubble image and right bubble image, Its possible to add images into layers. 
              Imagine you have two cells one left pointed and another one right pointed You have to Subclass the TableCell. Define a custom style and, depending on style value assigned you can add these images to the sublayer  of Backround view you have added(exlicitly added). <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Articles/ProvidingCALayerContent.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreAnimation_guide/Articles/ProvidingCALayerContent.html</a>
              Also do one thing. override the method layoutsubviews. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2504151/calayers-didnt-get-resized-on-its-uiviews-bounds-change-why">CALayers didn&#39;t get resized on its UIView&#39;s bounds change. Why?</a> its an example. 
              At this point reset the size of the sublayer of BackgroundView to the size of table cell. Now you have to just sepcify the  Tablecellheight in delgate method  <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006942-CH3-SW25" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UITableViewDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006942-CH3-SW25</a></p>
