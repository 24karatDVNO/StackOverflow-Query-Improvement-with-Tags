<p>Not to do your work for you, you will first have to parse the whole string to find the individual integers, either using <em>regular expressions</em> or, as I would do it myself, the <code>string.Split</code> method. Then parse the substrings representing the individual integers with the <code>int.Parse</code> or the <code>int.TryParse</code> methods.</p>
