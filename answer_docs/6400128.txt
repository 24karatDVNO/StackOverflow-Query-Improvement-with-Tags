<p>I haven't used it myself before, but I imagine it works similarly to scrollTop - take a look at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/scrollLeft/" rel="nofollow">scrollLeft()</a> One thing you'll need to do is find the starting scrollLeft position of the element before scrolling occurred and cache it - then subtract that from the new scrollLeft position obtained after scrolling.</p>

<p><strong>edit</strong> Wait, offset() isn't working? It should be working. </p>
