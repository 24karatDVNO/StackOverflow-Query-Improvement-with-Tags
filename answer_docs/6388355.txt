<p>Every time I'm asked to perform an audit on a site's accessibility maturity, the number one flaw is that the software isn't designed with accessibility in mind. Designers and developers many times have a thin understanding of accessibility. The believe they have thought of accessibility when in fact they haven't. </p>

<p>Many times solutions are inserted long after the product has been released. This results in the software being more difficult to make accessible. In addition, the level of accessibility cannot reach that of a software system that began with accessibility in mind. In the long term, it costs more money and has poorer results to 'force' accessibility into a product late in the life-cycle.</p>

<p>As far as the responsibility, it is the responsibility of the company to create an accessibility policy and then ensure it is correctly implemented. It needs to come from the top down or else it won't be a true consideration. The designers, developers testers and their managers all need to do their part to make certain the company's accessibility policy is living up to expectations. Marketing and public relations can benefit by talking about the accessibility of the software as an attribute of corporate responsibility the company is living up to.</p>
