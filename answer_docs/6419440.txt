<p>Pluralsight.com have a great course for ASP.NET Web Forms which should get you on a solid grounding using the ASP.NET framework.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/microsoft/courses/tableofcontents?courseName=aspdotnet-webforms4-intro" rel="nofollow">Building Applications with ASP.NET 4 WebForms</a></p>

<p>In particular, I would check out Working With DataSource Controls, which is more relevant to what you are trying to achieve.</p>
