<p>The programs that store or use system time in form of unsigned integers since 00:00:00 UTF will run out of range on Jan 19 2038. Although most softwares will face this problem in 2038, the ones that store future dates will get affected earlier.</p>

<p>The workaround will need a recompilation of (related) code that stores time in a larger storage format. Seemingly all the compiler providers are already ready with the solution.</p>

<p>Also, the 64 bit Operating systems are already using 64 bit wrappers for all time integers. This will put the danger well beyond our timeframe. Let the far next generations figure better solutions.</p>
