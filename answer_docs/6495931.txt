<p>I'm fairly sure the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-cc-developers-includes-incubating-components/indigor" rel="nofollow">CDT package</a> for eclipse uses GCC. There may be some additional installation required if you're using Windows, such as installing <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" rel="nofollow">Cygwin</a> with the GCC compiler.</p>
