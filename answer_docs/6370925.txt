<p>Sadly not. IE 6-8 don't include any sort of border-radius support. Your only solutions  are to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Know exactly how tall and wide your div is, and use a transparent PNG background, which still won't work on IE6. (not a great idea, makes your layout and sizing very inflexible)</li>
<li>Pollute your markup horribly with images and nested divs trying to do this. (you don't want to do this either)</li>
<li>Use a JavaScript library like CurvyCorners: <a href="http://www.curvycorners.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.curvycorners.net</a></li>
</ul>
