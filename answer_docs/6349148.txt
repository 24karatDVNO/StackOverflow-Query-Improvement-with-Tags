<p>OpenGL does not support text rendering directly. You have a variety of options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Some OS bindings, such as <strong>WGL</strong> and
<strong>AGL</strong>, do have limited font support
(mostly they render system fonts
into bitmaps for use in Open GL).</li>
<li>The <strong>GLUT</strong> toolkit (and similar
toolkits) also has some font support
(bitmap and stroke).</li>
<li>You can use a
library such as <strong>FreeType</strong> (mostly a
font renderer, you still may wish to
use something like <strong>Pango</strong> for text
layout).</li>
<li>You can use simple <strong>textured
quads</strong> (this is effectively what
Quake 1 did).</li>
