<p>Finally I am able to run OpenGL-ES2.0 on ubuntu 10.10 . Actually we need an emulator to run it on PC embeded with Linux(Ubuntu 10.10).You can get that emulator here <a href="http://www.imgtec.com/powervr/insider/sdk/KhronosOpenGLES2xSGX.asp" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<p>You just download it and there is a documentation in it how to run and compile.
Maybe you still not able to compile it because it needs graphic drivers enables and mesa libraries. If you are not able to run it tell me I may tell you where are you wrong.</p>
