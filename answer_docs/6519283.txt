<p>Do you use any unmanaged (com) components in your application?</p>

<p>If so, most likely you're including the 32bit version. If that's the case, you will have to compile 2 different versions of your program, one including the 32bit components, and the other including the 64bit components.</p>

<p>If that's not the case, it means you're using some platform specific code somewhere. More details about your application could help clarify the problem.</p>
