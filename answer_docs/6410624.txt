<p>There are two parts to make this work.</p>

<p>First part is the javascript, you need to make the selection to crop on the browser side. For that I use the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/jcrop/" rel="nofollow">jCrop</a> but there are <a href="http://www.hotscripts.com/blog/javascript-image-cropping-scripts/" rel="nofollow">more other</a>.</p>

<p>Ones you get the cordincate from the javascript code, you pass it on post back on the code behind that you make <a href="http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=asp.net+resize+and+crop+image" rel="nofollow">the resize and the crop.</a></p>
