<p>I'm not entirely sure that this is what you want, but to get the text to be vertically centered in an <code>input</code> field, you can set the <code>line-height</code> CSS property on the input field to the same as the height of that field.</p>

<p><code>.inputClass { height:50px; line-height:50px }</code></p>
