<p>Could you try below solution ..</p>

<p>Initially remove src attribute from ImageView ... save xml layout and then build the project. after that try to user divider.png instead of divder.9.png in 3 dpi folder in resources dir. Then again replace the code you commented out in xml layout .. Build again.. now there's should not be any problem.</p>
