<p>This is not good way to terminate any background task , competing the background thread execution is good   see this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1351976/how-to-kill-a-thread-with-objective-c/1352023#1352023">thread</a>. What you need , you need to lock an thread allocation for some kind of mishappenings. See NSLocks in developer documentation and some googling gives you some info about NSLock.</p>
