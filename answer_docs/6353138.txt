<p>I don't know Netbeans, but in Eclipse it automatically sets up a launch config which you can easily customise to specify the full package and class name containing the main class. </p>

<p>Ultimately any program launch is going to effective be a command line execution so I'd expect that netBeans must have a way to customise it as well. You just need to find that and adjust the launch (or setup a new one) for your second program.</p>
