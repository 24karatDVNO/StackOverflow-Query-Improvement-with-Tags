<p>You don't need to do any of those things.I had the same problem with debugging my HTC thunderbolt. All you have to do is download the official software from the phone's website.</p>

<p>Try one of these two links:
<a href="http://www.nero.com/download.php?id=motorolamedialink" rel="nofollow">http://www.nero.com/download.php?id=motorolamedialink</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.motorola.com/consumers/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=0351f6a559431210VgnVCM1000008406b00aRCRD" rel="nofollow">http://www.motorola.com/consumers/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=0351f6a559431210VgnVCM1000008406b00aRCRD</a></p>

<p>Download and install the software, and it should work. it did for me.</p>
