<p>You need to set it when you add a new row. It is then executed as an INSERT by the adapter. Adapters commit only changes.</p>

<p>The code would look almost like:</p>

<pre><code>var newRow = ClientTable.NewRow();

newRow["ClientID"] = GetNewID();
...set other fields...

ClientTable.Rows.Add(newRow);

Adapter.Update(ClientTable);
</code></pre>
