<p>You have to use a LIMIT clause:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT b1.tid AS Tid, MIN(DATEDIFF(b2.date,b1.date)) AS ResponseTime
FROM billing b1 inner join billing b2 
ON b1.tid = b2.tid
WHERE b1.action='New Support Ticket Opened'
AND b2.action LIKE 'New Ticket Response made by%'
AND b2.action != 'New Ticket Response made by User'
GROUP BY Tid
LIMIT 1
</code></pre>
