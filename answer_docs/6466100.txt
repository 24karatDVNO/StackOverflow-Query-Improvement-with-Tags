<p>You can make a struct (or class) for this.</p>

<pre><code>public struct IdAndName
{
    public int Id;
    public string Name;

    public IdAndName(int id, string name)
    {
        ID = id;
        Name = name;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You could also use a Tuple&lt;T1, T2>, (but that's not recommended as the properties aren't named.</p>
