<p>Unfortunately that's not available on Safari. We're developing Ovi Maps 3D and have the same problem - from what I know, Google had the same problem with Google Earth. Safari suppresses all the right mouse button events while it's pressed, so even if you'll block the context menu from showing, you won't get any mouse events.</p>

<p>The only thing I can suggest to you is a fallback for Safari, to allow moving the map while holding some modifier key - Shift or Alt.</p>
