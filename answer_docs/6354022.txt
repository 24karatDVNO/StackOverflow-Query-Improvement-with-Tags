<p>The basic answer is <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.64.8693&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" rel="nofollow">Mandatory Access Control</a>. The kind of access control most computer user are familir with is <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.857/OldStuff/Fall96/lectures/lecture24.ps.gz" rel="nofollow">Discressionary Access Control</a>. In DAC (Discressionary Access Control) everything on the computer is owned by a user. Users can grant access of an object (file, service, peripheral, memory, etc) to another user. Users can even transfer ownership of an object to another user. In MAC (Manditory Access Control) at least some objects are not owned by any user. The rules governing how users can access or interact with these objects are fixed and unchangable by any user. </p>

<p>In your example the data generated by the reporting system should be protected by Manditory Access Control, but the reporting system configuration may be owned by you. So you can control how the system behaves but not have access to the data it generates.</p>

<p>Microsoft began implementing MAC with Windows Vista. In Vista it was called Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC). </p>

<p>Linux can implement MAC with SELinux or AppArmor.</p>

<p>Mac OS X uses an implementation of the TrustedBSD MAC.</p>

<p>So, why isn't MAC used more often?
I takes effort. It is not easy to set up MAC, and it is hard to change once it is set up. It can be complicated. Most systems and services are built on the DAC model. Turning on MAC often makes services stop working. </p>
