<p>Option B sounds like a security risk and a maintenance nightmare.</p>

<p>Option A sounds much better.</p>

<p>Depending on your platform / framework there should already be mechanisms built-in which help with user profile related capabilities; so I'd see what currently exists in your chosen platform first.</p>

<p>I know that ASP.NET has a couple of mechanisms that provide solutions in this space.</p>

<p>A big consideration(which will impact design and implementation of such a system) will be how to build the "schema" of the profile in the first place; is it "baked-in" to the system or can admins dynamically (through the UI) modify the schema?</p>
