<p>Second option ( without grouping ) is by using internal row numbering, and limiting the row number to the first occurence.</p>

<p><pre><code>set @gallery_id = '';
set @num  = 1;</p>

<p>SELECT *
FROM gallery
    INNER JOIN (
        select id, picture, gallery_id
        from (
            select
                id, 
                picture, 
                gallery_id,
                @num := if(@gallery_id = gallery_id, @num + 1, 1) as row_number,
                @gallery_id := gallery_id as dummy
            from pictures
        ) as pictureRows
        where pictureRows.row_number = 1
    ) as firstPicture ON firstPicture.gallery_id = gallery.id;</pre></code></p>

<p>Hope this helps for you</p>
