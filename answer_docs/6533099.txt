<pre><code>$(document).ready(function() { 
    $("#edit-submit").click(function() {
        if($("#field-huima-0-value").val()=='' || $(".link-field .form-text").val() =='') {
           alert("you must at least enter one valueÔºÅ"); 
        });
    }
});
</code></pre>

<p>Try that - you need to run the code in the <code>click</code> event, your <code>if</code> statement wasn't containing the code I think you meant it to, and was testing to see if both fields were empty, not if either field was empty.</p>
