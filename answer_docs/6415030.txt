<p>By default, the front page has "Home" item and modules like Custom Breadcrumbs allows hiding it.
For an example, say node/35 and node/36 belongs to same contexts, but node/36 is the home page, the node/36(front page) will always has the "Home" part of the breadcrumb.
Also, if nodes are not assigned to taxonomy terms through a module, such as Forum, they will only has the Home > Node-Title breadcrumb where.
May be you are looking for Custom Breadcrumb of Menu Breadcrumb modules?</p>
