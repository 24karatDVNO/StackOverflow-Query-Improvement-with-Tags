<p>define in config/environments/production.rb or development.rb or whatever other modes you are running like stage.rb instead of writing/defining in config/environment.rb </p>

<p>I am using it and its serving my purpose. don't use the keyword RAILS_ENV (I haven't tried it) 
I am using it APP_MODE = "Production" In production environment file and APP_MODE = "Development" in development file. </p>

<p>then you can use this in your application to detect which mode you are in. </p>

<p>Hope, I answer the question </p>
