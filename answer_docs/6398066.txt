<p>Not really sure what your desired output, how you get the right misc for a given user, but here is the general idea</p>

<pre><code>SELECT userid, email, username, IF(email&lt;&gt;'',(SELECT avatar from misc where miscid = users.userid),null) avater FROM users;
</code></pre>

<p>this is a more readable version</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
  userid,
  email,
  username,
  IF(email&lt;&gt;''
    ,/*then*/(SELECT avatar from misc where miscid = users.userid)
    ,/*else*/null)
   as avater
FROM users;
</code></pre>

<p>Please provide a clear list of your tables, and an example desired output, and we can better assist.</p>

<p>The final desired example output is very helpful when designing MySQL statements.</p>
