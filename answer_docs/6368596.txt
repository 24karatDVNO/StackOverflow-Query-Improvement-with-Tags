<p>I'm not sure from your question exactly what you want to achieve. The above answer from Choise is solid advice. though if all you want is a twitter timeline displayed in a table you could achieve this more simply with a UIWebView and a pre-built twitter aggregator. I'd recommend something like this: </p>

<p>though I'd contact the developer first off to make sure they were fine with me using it in my application. </p>

<p>If you do use something of this ilk, to get it to work you need to include the .js file in the Copy Bundle resources folder in xcode. A quick google (or even search of this site) should provide the required advice. Good luck!</p>
