<p>Unfortunately, this feature isn't supported by the current ContextMenu control. You can find more information in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/delay/archive/2010/04/15/alive-and-kickin-new-silverlight-4-toolkit-released-with-today-s-silverlight-4-rtw.aspx" rel="nofollow">this article</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>That said, please pay attention to the
  word "subset"; the Toolkit's
  ContextMenu doesn't have all the
  features of WPF's quite yet. Notably,
  it doesn't support multi-level menu
  item nesting. However, none of the
  customers I asked felt that nesting
  was necessary right now, so I don't
  expect its absence to be a big
  limitation.</p>

<p>You can also find more information about the control and a possible way to simulate the feature <a href="http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Anatomy-of-the-ContextMenu-how-it-is-made-how-to-use-it-and-how-to-abuse-it.aspx" rel="nofollow">in this article on SilverlightShow</a>. However, the solution doesn't look as expected, so I'm not sure if you will find it useful.</p>
