<p>basically for this to work, the wall movieclips need to be children of the bg movieclip and have the names provided (in this case "wallTop", "wallBottom", "wallRight" and "wallLeft". i'm assuming you're doing this through flash itself (as opposed to doing it through pure code), so double click on the bg movieclip, make sure the walls are in there, click once on them, and make sure their <code>instance name</code> is set right.</p>

<p>by having some code <code>bg.wallTop</code>, what you're saying is "look in the movieclip 'bg' for the child movieclip 'wallTop'"</p>
