<p>I could not reproduce your problem, but I don't think that image inputs return a value, only .x and .y. The following works in Chrome, Firefox and IE (sorry about vb.net):</p>



<pre class="lang-vb prettyprint-override"><code>Public Class ImageButtonViewData
    Public Property X As String
    Public Property Y As String

    Public ReadOnly Property WasClicked As Boolean
        Get
            Return Not String.IsNullOrEmpty(X)
        End Get
    End Property

End Class
</code></pre>
