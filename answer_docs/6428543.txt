<p>In order to do this, you would need to be able to access the parent element from inside the iframe but because the content is from 2 different domains (parent content on Facebook server, iframe content on your server) cross domain restrictions apply and you will not be able to.  So you will only be able to pop it up inside the 560 width iframe facebook gives you.  </p>
