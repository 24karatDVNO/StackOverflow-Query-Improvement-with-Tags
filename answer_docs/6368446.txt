<p>I would try to use <code>getWidth()</code>. If you want to do that though, you have to be careful when you call it. It only makes sense after the view hierarchy is laid out. That means that trying to check <code>onCreate</code>, <code>onStart</code> or even <code>onResume</code> will probably not get the results that you want. As an experiment, you can call it in a click handler of a button and you should see the expected value correctly being returned. I can't really say any more about where you should get it without knowing what you want to use it for.</p>
