<p>I'm also developing in the same environment and looking at adding navigation to our app. In our case the device will be in a vehicle so we want "Tom Tom" style nav rather than "top down" Google Maps. </p>

<p>We are using Resco controls which are excellent. They have recently released a navigation control that you can just drag on to a form. I'm hoping to evaluate this soon. This stuff isn't cheap but you might want to check out the demo if your project has the budget. Resco are an excellent company to deal with (no affiliation - just that they have made my app look cool and saved me a LOT of work).</p>
