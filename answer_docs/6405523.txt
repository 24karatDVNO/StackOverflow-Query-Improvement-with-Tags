<p>Without knowing details about <code>getSubObject()</code>, there is no way to know how to truly answer the question. The answer <em>should</em> lie in the documentation for <code>getSubObject()</code> (But not everyone follows that <em>should</em>.) That documentation might be in some old-style document, some doxygen (or similar) page, the header file that declares <code>getSubObject()</code>. If worst comes to worst, you'll need to look at the source code that defines <code>getSubObject()</code>, assuming that the source is available.</p>

<p>When reading that documentation/header/source, you should be looking for an answer to the question "Does <code>getSubObject()</code> allocate memory that the caller must delete, or does it merely return a pointer to an existing object?" With a name like <code>getSubObject()</code> I would expect the latter is the case. I would expect the former if the name of the function was <code>createSubObject()</code>.</p>
