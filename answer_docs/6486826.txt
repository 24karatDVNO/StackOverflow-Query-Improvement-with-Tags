<p>One of the main reasons is that Spring is used to inject implementations. Usually, extended classes are the implementations and it's natural to pick up the configuration details from their definitions.</p>

<p>Other practical reason is that annotations are not inherited. If an interface has annotated methods this annotation is not automatically visible in the implementing/extending classes without some reflection gymnastics.</p>
