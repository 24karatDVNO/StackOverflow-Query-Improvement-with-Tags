<p>Registry way is working fine for me IF I don't have any dependencies on other assemblies.</p>

<p>The problem you face may most likely due to inability to locate the dependencies for your extension. </p>

<p>CodedUITestBuilder does not look at the dependent assemblies at the location you mention. You may need to tinker the configuration files to resolve your dependent assemblies.</p>
