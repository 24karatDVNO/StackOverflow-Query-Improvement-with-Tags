<p>I create my own version of the SvcMgr.pas file to eliminate the in-place hook to the Application global exception handler so that I can instantiate my own. I do this because 1) I could find no other simple way of doing this, and 2) since this unit is a stand-alone unit that is only included with Windows Services then the effect on other units is minimal. You can download the code from my web-site to see how this works.</p>
