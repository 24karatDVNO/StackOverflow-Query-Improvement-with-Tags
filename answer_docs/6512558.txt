<p>MASM32 is an entire SDK, like joni said. It contains an editor, some help files, and basically everything you need to code in the MASM language. Also, it's worth noting that MASM32 does indeed contain version 8 of MASM; you're not missing anything. I personally recommend MASM32 as a package, it makes starting off in MASM much easier, but you can do it all from scratch and use just the original MASM assembler and figure it out from there.</p>
