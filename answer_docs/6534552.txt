<p>I have use threads and the onTouchEvent(MotionEvent event). As the OnLongClickListener is for a click event and I want to keep it pressed. When I touch the screen a boolean variable is true, and a thread start counting until a limit. If I move my finger then event.ACTION_MOVE fires, the boolean variable became false and the Thread stops.</p>
