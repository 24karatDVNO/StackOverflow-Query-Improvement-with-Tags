<p>Take a look at <a href="http://staf.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">STAF (Software Test Automation Framework)</a></p>

<p>It looks like it might be a good fit for what you need.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Software Testing Automation Framework (STAF) is an open source, multi-platform, multi-language framework designed around the idea of reusable components, called services (such as process invocation, resource management, logging, and monitoring). STAF removes the tedium of building an automation infrastructure, thus enabling you to focus on building your automation solution. The STAF framework provides the foundation upon which to build higher level solutions, and provides a pluggable approach supported across a large variety of platforms and languages.</p>
