<p>I have successfully converted <a href="http://www.sohtanaka.com/web-design/markup-hierarchy-advantages-seo/" rel="nofollow">Soh Tanaka's Layout</a> into a 3-column one. It's not perfect - it seems that, with CSS, nothing can be - but it's a start.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.2shared.com/file/VoP-yo8L/layout.html" rel="nofollow">My version</a> is a bit of a mess, but it's can easily be a start for someone trying to do this sort of thing. And here's a <a href="http://www.2shared.com/file/Q1tWbPiq/layout-sw.html" rel="nofollow">version with the left/right columns swapped</a>.</p>

<p>Mind the DOCTYPE - if it's HTML 4.01, it might need to be changed to XHTML Transitional; otherwise, the layout might not work in IE. Or perhaps it might.</p>
