<p>The perl language binding is quite reliable and up-to-date. </p>

<p>On the CPAN, the current release Test-WWW-Selenium-1.25     is from     28 Apr 2011. It's actively maintained.</p>

<p>Perl's Test Runners and TAP are cool. There are many other testing modules that you can combine with Test-WWW-Selenium.</p>

<p>Using E-P-I-C perl Editor for the Eclipse IDE, you'd get statement completion in your testcase files.</p>

<p>The Perl API calls are written in a slightly different naming convention: for instance, getEval becomes get_eval 
but this is a minor point. </p>

<p>IMHO, the perl code template that Selenium IDE generates for you is ok, it can be adapted. (e.g. I prefer Test::Fatal instead of Test::Exception.)</p>

<p>Cannot say anything about the other language bindings. </p>

<p>Choose the language you are most familiar with, and start building up your expert knowledge of testing tricks, Selenium and browser idiosyncrasies. this will take a lot of time anyway.</p>
