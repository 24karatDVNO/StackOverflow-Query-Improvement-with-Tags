<p>Thats correct as it is.</p>

<p>You could even ommit the @JoinColumn Statement as it will default to this values.</p>

<p>If you want a bidirectional relationship you also have to set the relationship on the group class like this:</p>

<pre><code>@OneToMany(targetEntity="User", mappedBy="group")
private $users;
</code></pre>
