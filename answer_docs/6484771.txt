<p>try to dispose all the texture in the onDestroy() method. that way all the texture will be destroyed when you exit/finish the activity.</p>

<pre><code>   @Override
protected void onDestroy() {
    super.onDestroy();
    for(Texture t:textures) {
        t.dispose();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>note : I don't really know that Android has it own texture class. I used libgdx and there's a dispose method to call. maybe you should find a way to dispose all those garbage. If i recall there's a recycle() method in Bitmap class that do similiar thing.</p>
