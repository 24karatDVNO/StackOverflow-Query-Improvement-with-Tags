<p>No, you don't need to release it.  The <code>dataWithContentsOfURL:</code> method returns an <code>autorelease</code> object.  It will be release automatically if you do not explicitly retain it.</p>

<p>Automatically, that is, so long as your current thread has an <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> properly set up for it.  All <code>autorelease</code> objects are released when their enclosing <code>NSAutoreleasePool</code> is drained.  If you have found a leak in this code, then perhaps the corresponding pool is not being drained frequently enough (or perhaps not at all).</p>
