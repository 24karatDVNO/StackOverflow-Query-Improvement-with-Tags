<p><code>malloc</code> is only guaranteed to return you a block of memory that's at least as big as the size you give it.  However, processors are generally more efficient when they're operating on blocks of memory that start at multiples of, say, 8 bytes in memory.  Look up <em>word size</em> for more information on this.</p>
