<p>You should be able to run the Silverlight bits and still target older versions, if that is what you are asking, as these are incremental builds (barring a new framework version, of which I know of none immediately planned). So the short answer is yes, you can do it.</p>

<p>The longer answer is you may still experience bugs. Perhaps not in your release product, which is you stated goal, but any addition of betaware presents a possible danger. So plan accordingly. Fortunately, you should be able to back out of this one fairly easy due to the way both Silverlight and VS work today.</p>
