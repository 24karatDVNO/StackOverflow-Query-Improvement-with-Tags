<p>"When I clean the project it now gives me errors that R cannot be resolved as a variable. Where should I go from here?"</p>

<p>It sounds like you have an error in your code somewhere. You need to find out where the error is (what file and line) and fix it. This can be done with the problems tab in eclipse. It should tell you the description, file, path, line, and type of error you are getting.</p>
