<p>I finally solved this by creating my own "version 0" cookie. When doing so it seems like the second cookie doesnÂ´t get created, or atleast my own cookie gets picked up instead. So in my while loop, the code now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>Cookie cookie = cooks.next();
sb.append("$Version=0; ");
sb.append(cookie.getName()+"="+cookie.getValue());
if (cooks.hasNext()) {
    sb.append(";");
}
sb.append("; $Path=/");
</code></pre>
