<p>I've never been successful at finding a way to filter the children like you want to do. In order to reduce the volume of data being retrieved from the database I will usually retrieve just the parent objects and then loop over them getting only the children I want and "attach" them to the parent. That's not a hard-and-fast rule though, it kind of depends on how many children there are for each parent and what percentage of them I'm likely to want to keep.</p>
