<p>There are two ways to simplify XML parsing.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If you have the XML schema then, <a href="http://jaxb.java.net/" rel="nofollow">JAXB</a> can do the XML to Java conversion.</p></li>
<li><p>You can create a utility class to parse the name value pairs by passing it the XML in a constructor.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Slightly unrelated to your original question but, if you are using myMethod() to connect to multiple URLs then, I would make parallel calls to speed up the response.
