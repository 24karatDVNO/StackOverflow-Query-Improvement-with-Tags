<p>I would recommend using <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/c_str/" rel="nofollow">c_str</a> to represent your string as an array of characters (or even better begin with an array of characters rather than the string datatype). After you do this write a function to go through each array and compare characters (removing where required), its a bit inefficient but it'll do the job and its simple.</p>
