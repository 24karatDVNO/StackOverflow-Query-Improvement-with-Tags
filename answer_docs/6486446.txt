<p>Here's what will happen:</p>

<ol>
<li>you forget the name of your macro</li>
<li>you start typing existing iterator stuff over and over again</li>
<li>soon typing it is so automatic that it'll be easy and fast to do</li>
<li>then your macro will no longer be needed</li>
</ol>

<p>Of course, getting there takes small amount of effort, but everyone will get there at some point...</p>
