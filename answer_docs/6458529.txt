<p>I think you have the right idea. Looks like a navigation controller with a customized nav bar (see <a href="http://idevrecipes.com/2011/01/12/how-do-iphone-apps-instagramreederdailybooth-implement-custom-navigationbar-with-variable-width-back-buttons/" rel="nofollow">http://idevrecipes.com/2011/01/12/how-do-iphone-apps-instagramreederdailybooth-implement-custom-navigationbar-with-variable-width-back-buttons/</a> for an example) and either a custom toolbar or just a UIView containing a couple of buttons.</p>
