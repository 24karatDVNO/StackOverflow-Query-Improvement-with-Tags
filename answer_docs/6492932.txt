<p>I have noticed this aswell under slightly different circumstances. If you explicitly assign a converter to an inputelement and have null as value (noSelecrtion), it will for some weird reason send the label instead of the value to the converter. I go around the problem by using the forClass attribute of @FacesConverter, or using JSF default converters (the enum one works okay for me).</p>
