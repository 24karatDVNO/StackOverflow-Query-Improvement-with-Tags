<p>The rotation matrices look like this (assuming column vector representation):</p>

<pre><code>[   1      0       0   ]
[   0    cos(a)  sin(a)] = Rx(a)
[   0   -sin(a)  cos(a)] 

[ cos(a)   0    -sin(a)]
[   0      1       0   ] = Ry(a)
[ sin(a)   0     cos(a)]

[ cos(a) sin(a)   0    ]
[-sin(a) cos(a)   0    ] = Rz(a)
[   0      0      1    ]
</code></pre>

<p>Multiplying 'local' means that the matrix goes on the right.  Multiplying 'global' means the matrix goes on the left.  So your rotation is <strong>Ry(35째)*Rx(35째)</strong>.  Or approximately:</p>

<pre><code>[ .819  .329 -.469 ]
[  0    .019  .574 ]
[ .574 -.470  .671 ]
</code></pre>

<p>The Euler rotation order XYZ means <strong>Rx(ax)*Ry(ay)*Rz(az)</strong>.  So, if you plug in the numbers <strong>Rx(40.524째)*Ry(-28.024째)*Rz(-21.881)</strong>, you get approximately (within round-off error) the same matrix (I did try it, just to make sure).</p>
