<p>Why not this?</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;string&gt; list = collection.Select(control =&gt; 
    SearchForControl(control, someOtherParameters).InnerText).ToList();
</code></pre>

<p>You don't need two selects.</p>

<p>If you do need to wrap things like in your second case I would put the dots at the beginning of the line so you can see the line is a continuation.</p>
