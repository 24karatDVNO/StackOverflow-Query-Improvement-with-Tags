<p>So, if I have to demonstrate <code>A*(B-C)/D-E</code> with stack operation, I am doing this right:</p>

<pre><code>PUSH A
PUSH B
PUSH C
SUB
MUL
PUSH D
DIV
PUSH E
SUB
</code></pre>

<p>Then, the top of stack would have what <code>A*(B-C)/D-E</code> evaluates to. Actually this needs to be done with zero-address format register and i believe using stack this way is how it is done.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the help.</p>

<p>Highly appreciated.</p>
