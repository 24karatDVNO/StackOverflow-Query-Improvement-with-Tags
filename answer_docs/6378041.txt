<p>I accomplished this by creating an additional section with its own sub-record detail to house what would span multiple pages and left the original section to house only the header record. </p>

<p>So the breakdown looked something like this in the Hierarchy pane:</p>

<pre><code>MainForm
 +-MasterPage           (Main layout)
 +-subForm              (Layer over Main page)
   +-SubFormDetail      (Sub For on Layer)
     +-MainTable        (Primary Table)   
       +-HeaderSection  (Section to display first page only header)
       +-DetailSection  (Section to display multi-page rows)
         +-DetailRows   (Rows to display each records data)
</code></pre>

<p>Although admittedly this may not be the best method to accomplish what you are trying to do, it worked for my needs.</p>

<p>Hope that helps.</p>
