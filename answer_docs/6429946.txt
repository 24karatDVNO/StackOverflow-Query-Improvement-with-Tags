<p>I usually delay defining a variable until just before it's used, roughly as Scott recommends.</p>

<p>IMO, however, if "where it's needed" is really a <em>lot</em> different from "the beginning of the block" (or even "beginning of the function"), chances are pretty fair that you're writing single functions that are probably larger than ideal, and your code might benefit from being broken up into pieces that are smaller, simpler, and more understandable.</p>
