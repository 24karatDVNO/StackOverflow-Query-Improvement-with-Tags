<p>Well, in Python 2, you can say:</p>

<pre><code>point = 1, 2
size = 2, 3
color = 'red'

class Rect(object):
    def __init__(self, (x, y), (width, height), color):
        pass
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can say:</p>

<pre><code>a_rect= Rect(point, size, color)
</code></pre>

<p>taking care that the first two arguments are sequences of len == 2.<br>
NB: This capability has been removed from Python 3.</p>
