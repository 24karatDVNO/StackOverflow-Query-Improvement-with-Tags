<p>Quoting from <a href="http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Installation</strong></p>

<p>The LuaBinaries files are intended for advanced users and programmers who want to incorporate Lua in their applications or distributions and would like to keep compatibility with LuaBinaries, so they also will be compatible with many other modules available on the Internet.</p>

<p>If what you want is a full Lua installation, please check other projects such as the Lua for Windows and LuaRocks.</p>

<p>Seems quite clear to me that you should download Lua for Windows.</p>
