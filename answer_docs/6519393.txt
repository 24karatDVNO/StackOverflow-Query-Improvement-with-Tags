<p>Such conversion is not allowed, because if the conversion would be possible, you could modify the const object in a following way:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

const double A0 = 0;
const double A1 = 1;
const double* A[2] = { &amp;A0, &amp;A1 };
double * B[2];

int main()
{
  double** b = B;
  const double ** a = b; // illegal
  //const double ** a = (const double **)b; // you can simulate it would be legal

  a[0] = A[0];
  b[0][0] = 2; // modified A0

  printf("%f",A[0][0]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>For a simulated result, check the <a href="http://ideone.com/Ud4OU" rel="nofollow">code at IdeOne.com</a> - you will get SIGSEGV (const object was placed in read only memory and you are trying to modify it). With a different platform the object might be modified silently.</p>
