<p>Sometimes a combination of both methods, is used, like generating code with a parser, and later, modifying "by hand" that code.</p>

<p>Other way is that some scanner (lexer) and parser tools allow them to add custom code, additional to the grammar rules, called "semantic actions". A good example of this case, is that, a parser detects generic identifiers, and some custom code, transform some specific identifiers into keywords.</p>

<p>EDIT:
add "semantic actions"</p>
