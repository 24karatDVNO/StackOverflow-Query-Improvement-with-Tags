<p>The keyword <code>this</code> is simply a reference -- within an instance of a class -- to itself.  </p>

<p>There are two common uses of "this" in Android.  These aren't particular to Android, but are valid in Java in general.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><code>this.getResources()</code> says to call the <code>getResources()</code> method on <code>this</code> instance.  The <code>this</code> portion of it is usually unnecessary and used implicitly.</p></li>
<li><p><code>Foo.this.getResources()</code> could be called from an inner class.  This could be handy if the inner class defines <code>getResources()</code> also, but you want the version defined in the other class.</p></li>
</ol>
