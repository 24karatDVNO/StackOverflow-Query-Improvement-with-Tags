<p>In C# memory isn't deallocated immediately, even when <code>Dispose</code> is called. It is freed up at a later point in time by the garbage collector. The garbage collector is regularly run automatically in the background. If you can see that it continues to use more and more memory over a long time (10th of minutes) you can start worrying about a resource leak.</p>
