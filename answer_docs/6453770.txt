<p>What do you mean by in a row?  Do you mean all in one cell?  You can do that by using a GridTemplateColumn.  If you want buttons to appear as a nested item, meaning you have to hit the drop down icon on the left to see more info, you can put whatever content you want there by adding a NestedViewTemplate (or similarly named).</p>
