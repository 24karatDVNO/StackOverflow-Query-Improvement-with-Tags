<p>Are the images taken standing from the same position but you're just rotated a bit so that they're not aligned correctly? If so then the images are related by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homography" rel="nofollow">homography</a> - i.e. a projective transformation. Given a set of correspondences between the images (you need at least 4 pairs), the standard way to find the homography is to use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_linear_transformation" rel="nofollow">DLT algorithm</a>.</p>
