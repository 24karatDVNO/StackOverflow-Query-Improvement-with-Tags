<p>there are many libraries which can you use.</p>

<p>for the A and B they can running hessian server(for listening) + client(for sending)
and for the proxy server you can use JMS + hessian server + client same as for A and B.
In this way you can send java objects.</p>

<p>But hessian is only on suggestion you can use RMI or spring remoting or maybe web services.
By far which a have working hessian is the fastest and very easy to develop.</p>

<p>from 1 to 4 you ask how to design a application which is out of the scope and you need to do it by you self :).</p>
