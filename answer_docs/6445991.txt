<p>Silverlight tooltips currently don't have the extended functionality that WPF provide to set delay or duration.</p>

<p>As much as I'd like to see this functionality baked into Silverlight, I've had to build something myself. This also meant I had to create my own ToolTipService as lots of the code I needed to hook into was internal.</p>

<p>Replace your references to ToolTipService and ToolTip to the ones in the library and you'll get more properties to exploit :-)</p>

<p>You can find it on <a href="http://tooltipservice.codeplex.com" rel="nofollow">Codeplex</a> as well as on <a href="http://www.nuget.org/List/Packages/Silverlight.Advanced.ToolTips" rel="nofollow">NuGet</a>.
Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Cheers,
Xavier</p>
