<p>I think this is what you are trying to achieve, although it is difficult to tell from the code that you have provided:</p>

<pre><code>list1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
list2 = ['a_replaced', 'b_replaced', 'c_replaced', 'd_replaced']
text = open(textfile, 'r')
for line in text:
    for index, old in enumerate(list1):
        line = line.replace(old, list2[index])
    print line
text.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This should work. Comment to clarify</p>
