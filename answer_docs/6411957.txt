<p>Did some testing on your code and some thoughts came to me: </p>

<ol>
<li>Your contentPopup references a Canvas when there is no such canvas.</li>
<li>Might consider hiding the contentPresenter when showing the contentPopup.</li>
<li>After wrapping the contentPopup in a canvas, but still not sure, the items container doesn't seem to allow you to move your items out of the listbox without hiding them.</li>
</ol>
