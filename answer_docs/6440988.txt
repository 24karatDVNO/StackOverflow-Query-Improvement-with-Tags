<p>By default ExtJs fields don't have a <strong>getForm()</strong> method to get access to their parent. However, you can use <a href="http://www.lustforge.com/2011/06/19/extjs-field-getform-override/" rel="nofollow">this override</a> to add this method. Once you've got the form, you can get access to any field you like, which should let you do what you describe. </p>
