<p>If you launch a java application, and you embed your code into a loop:</p>

<pre><code>while(true){
...
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will never stop, the only reason why it should stop it's because an exception is launched (do you consume resources inside the while) ?
In case it really stops, try to understand what is the problem in this way:</p>

<pre><code>while(true){
  try{
     ... your code ....
     }catch(Throwable t){
      system.out.println("This is my problem:" + t.printStackTrace);
     }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Sure it helps</p>
