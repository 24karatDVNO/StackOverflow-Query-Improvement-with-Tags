<p>You have to compare the image's aspect ratio with your viewport's before deciding whether to resize by width or height.</p>

<p>If your image display area is <code>viewport_w</code> x <code>viewport_h</code> and uploaded image is <code>w</code> x <code>h</code>, then (pseudo-code):</p>

<pre><code>viewport_aspect_ratio = viewport_w / viewport_h;
image_aspect_ratio = w / h;

if (image_aspect_ratio &gt; viewport_aspect_ratio) {
    // image aspect ratio is wider than our viewport
    // resize to fit viewport width
    new_w = viewport_w;
    new_h = image_h * viewport_w / image_w;
} else {
    // image aspect ratio is taller than our viewport
    // resize to fit viewport height
    new_w = image_w * viewport_h / image_h;
    new_h = viewport_h;
}

// resize image to new_w x new_h
</code></pre>
