<p>If you're using Visual Studio, pressing F5 will run the code in the debugger, and Ctrl+F5 will run the code normally. Just remember to include a <code>cin.get()</code> statement at the end or the terminal window will close before you can read the output.</p>

<p>Other IDEs should have similar functions. Check in the Run or Debug menu.</p>

<p>EDIT: Sorry, didn't see that you're asking about running it with arguments. In VS, in Project Properties there are the Debugging settings. Within that, there is a field called Command Arguments. These will get passed to the application when you run it from within VS.</p>
