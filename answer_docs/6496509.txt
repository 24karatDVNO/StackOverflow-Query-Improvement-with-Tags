<p>if <code>calculate</code> doesn't return anything you have to be explicit and say that with <code>void</code>.</p>

<p>It also needs a method body (unless it is marked as <code>abstract</code>).</p>

<pre><code>public class Hello : Form
{
    public string test { get; set; }
    void calculate() {}
}
</code></pre>
