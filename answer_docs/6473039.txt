<p>I'm using <code>[[UIApplication sharedApplication] statusBarOrientation]</code> based on this post: <a href="http://www.ddeville.me/2011/01/getting-the-interface-orientation-in-ios/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ddeville.me/2011/01/getting-the-interface-orientation-in-ios/</a></p>

<p>Is that what you tried that you said didn't work? I had trouble with <code>[[UIDevice currentDevice] orientation]</code>, but the status bar did the trick -- though not in <code>applicationDidFinishLaunching</code>. I'm using it in the rotation callback method, which gets called immediately afterwards anyway. (And the callback appears to get called twice back-to-back at application startup, the first time with the incorrect <code>UIDeviceOrientationPortrait</code> and the second time with the correct orientation.)</p>
