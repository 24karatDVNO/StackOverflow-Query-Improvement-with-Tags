<p>I guess you're using Apache-FOP to do the pdf-rendering for you. Apache-FOP rendering is about interpreting the XSL-FO tags and rendering them to matching pdf-elements.
The answer to your question is in the generation of the XSL-FO for which you say you use XSLT. Check what the XSLT does with a 'title of a part element' and change it to your liking.</p>

<p>Good luck with your project,
