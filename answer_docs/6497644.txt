<p>How do you know which Credit Card to fetch? You have a Person entity, who has a creditCard property which refers to a CreditCard object (different entity). You don't have to ask Core Data to perform another fetch, hitting the creditCard property on the <code>person</code> reference causes it to 'fault' the object and fetch the related CreditCard entity automatically. If it's a one-to-many relationship, the property is actually an NSSet representing all the CreditCards related to that person. <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/Articles/cdTechnologyOverview.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009296-SW1" rel="nofollow">Read the Core Data guide</a>, it's full of great information like this.</p>
