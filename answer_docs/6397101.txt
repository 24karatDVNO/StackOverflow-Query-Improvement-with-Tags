<p>John,</p>

<p>If you are not using biuld-in validation controls, its better to write validation methods on the server in order to protect the server from vulnerability or from incorrect formats. Your jquery validation methods for some reason could not be executed (for example if the javascript on the client is disabled)</p>

<p>Hope this helps...
