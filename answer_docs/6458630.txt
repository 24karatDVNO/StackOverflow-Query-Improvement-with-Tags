<p>Yes, it is possible.  You need to do two things:</p>

<p>1) Open that "portnumber" for incoming connections through your windows firewall (and any other firewall you may be running).</p>

<p>2) Set up your router to allow incoming connections on that "portnumber" and route those connections to your local computer's IP Address.</p>

<p>That should do it. Be aware that doing this opens up your computer to be hacked if you are not careful. </p>
