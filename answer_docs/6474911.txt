<p>You can also pass in the name into the function above by doing it this way, and then you'd have a function that can start any workflow on any item:</p>

<pre><code>public void StartWF(SPListItem listItem, SPSite spSite, string wfName)  
{ 
   SPList parentList = listItem.ParentList;      
   SPWorkflowAssociationCollection associationCollection = parentList.WorkflowAssociations;        
   foreach (SPWorkflowAssociation association in associationCollection) 
   {
       if (association.Name == wfName) 
       {
           association.AutoStartChange = true;
           association.AutoStartCreate = false;
           association.AssociationData = string.Empty; 
           spSite.WorkflowManager.StartWorkflow(listItem, association,  association.AssociationData);
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
