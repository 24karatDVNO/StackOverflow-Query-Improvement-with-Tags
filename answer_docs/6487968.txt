<p>Can you run <a href="http://www.linuxpowertop.org/" rel="nofollow">powertop</a> on Android machines? It's an awesome tool, but it may require infrastructure not supported in default kernel builds.</p>

<p>Less directly related to <em>power</em>, but still capable of giving you full-system information is <a href="http://oprofile.sourceforge.net/news/" rel="nofollow">oprofile</a>. It too might require infrastructure not supported in default kernel builds, but it can show full-system profiling information.</p>
