<p>You can access iOS Simulator's store at</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>~/Application Support/iPhone Simulator</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(where the tilde represents your home folder).</p>

<p>Maybe you could create an alias in your application's sandbox and access. iOS supports traversal of HFS+ symlinks. (Although I haven't tried as of today.)</p>

<p>By the way, I don't think there's a way to add photos to the simulator's Photos app. At least not with the above method.</p>
