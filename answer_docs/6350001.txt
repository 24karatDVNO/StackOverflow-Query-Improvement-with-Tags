<p>You are mixing javascript and php. What you need to do is send an ajax request to the server in the callback of the <code>subscribe</code> function.</p>

<p>On the server side you need to have a php script that processes your sent-in variables and adds them to the database.</p>

<p>Are you using any kind of javascript library?</p>
