<p>From my experience you should use Android 2.2.  I have run into very few bugs with the emulator and graphical layout of the xml files.  Also if you walk into any AT&amp;T store most of the phones right now will ship with Android 2.2.  Android 3.0 is for tablets only.  Your 2.2 application will still work on tablets.</p>
