<p>First, 0.3725 mm = 0.03725 cm</p>

<p>milli = 1/1000th, centi = 1/100th.  I hope that helps clear up the differences in your math.</p>

<p>The pixels/points/inches relationship is a variable one depending on your technology.  Most displays on the market today use 72 physical pixels in every linear inch.  That can vary some in video, as they have some resolutions that have a 0.9:1 pixel aspect ratio, and not a 1:1, but that doesn't really apply in this context.</p>

<p>Most operating systems display what they believe to be 96 dots per inch (or points), but that differs between OS's, and obviously screen size matters.  If you're running a 20" display at 600x800 resolution, your dots per inch are going to be larger.</p>

<p>That means 72 dots may or may not equal 1 inch.  It depends on the screen size, the DPI setting, and the resolution the screen is running at.</p>

<p>A fair explanation is at:  <a href="http://www.emdpi.com/screendpi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.emdpi.com/screendpi.html</a> </p>

<p>I know that doesn't clear everything up, but hopefully it lays out the variables you're dealing with.</p>
