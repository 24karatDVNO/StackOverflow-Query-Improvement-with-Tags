<p><code>&amp;</code> is bitwise AND operator. So <code>&amp; 0x7fffffff</code> stripping off the signed bit from an 32 bit integer.  That means, it makes the leftmost bit of <code>int</code> zero.</p>

<p>And in the second one, first <code>n</code> is left-shifted with 13 using <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator which is left-shift operator, and the result of this expression used in XOR operation with <code>n</code> itself.</p>
