<p>The way your query is written, you limit the results from playlist_assignments to 1. If I understand correctly, you just want one playlist but all the videos from that playlist. In that case, modifying your query this way should work</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM ( 
SELECT id, title
FROM playlists p 
WHERE 1 and title = 'My Top Videos'
LIMIT 1
)d 
JOIN playlist_assignments pa 
USING(id) 
JOIN videos v 
USING (youtube_id)
ORDER BY position ASC
</code></pre>
