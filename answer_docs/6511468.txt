<p>If you are using Websphere RAD 7.5 it allows you to export a backup of your server profile preferences. So all of that configuration for databases and classpath can be backed up. I would try deploying that to your team and see if that helps.</p>

<p>Right click on the server, then click Server Configuration> Backup . </p>

<p>Hopefully that does the trick. </p>
