<p>The reason why are you getting zero hits is because the way you index information and the way you query is different.</p>

<p>When you index your information, you use <code>StandardAnalyzer</code> which internally uses <code>LowerCaseFilter</code>, and all your data sits lowercased inside the index.</p>

<p>When you query, you construct "raw" query (using <code>TermQuery</code>) which isn't lowercasing your term value. If you would change line</p>

<pre><code>Term t = new Term("content", "Alan");
</code></pre>

<p>into</p>

<pre><code>Term t = new Term("content", "alan");
</code></pre>

<p>you would get desired result. Obviously, this is a bad approach - you want to achieve the same by parsing query and reusing the same analyzer, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code>Query q = MultiFieldQueryParser.parse(
                    Version.LUCENE_30,
                    "content:Alan",
                    new String[]{"content"},
                    new BooleanClause.Occur[] {BooleanClause.Occur.SHOULD},
                    analyzer
);
</code></pre>

<p>You can probably use different type of query, but you got the idea.</p>

<p>p.s. next time do not include information which is irrelevant to the problem (PDF stuff).</p>
