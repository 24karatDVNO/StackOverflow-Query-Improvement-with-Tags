<p>Node export maintainer here - I wouldn't even bother trying this.  I'm really stuck on converting D6 nodes to D7, and how to convert CCK and taxonomy to the D7 Fields, and the lack of content type import makes it even more difficult.  Quite disappointing.  If anyone can lend a hand please seek out the node_export issue queue.</p>
