<p>Suggestion one: after you insert one of the rows, remove it from the csv file</p>

<p>Suggestion two: update a file or mysql with last inserted csv row and with next run skip all other entries before that row.</p>

<p>Also, you can add a limit of 30 seconds per execution or 100/1000/X rows per execution (which works best before the script terminates). That will work for both suggestions.</p>
