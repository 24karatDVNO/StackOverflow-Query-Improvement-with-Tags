<p>I went through the full exercise of trying to use nokogiri when I found a bug in REXML that I didn't want to use the workaround for.  I was unsuccessful in adding the library.  (I got it to the point where it would load, but every single parsed document returned nil.)</p>

<p>According to the developers who watch <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rhomobile" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/rhomobile</a> , they do not support nokogiri on the device -- only on the RhoSync platform.</p>
