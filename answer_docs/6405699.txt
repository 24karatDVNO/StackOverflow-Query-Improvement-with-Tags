<p>I'm working on a fork of heroku_san that will (eventually) remove the coupling between Rails &amp; heroku_san. Right now, I'm working on making a testable class. <a href="https://github.com/kmayer/heroku_san" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/kmayer/heroku_san</a>  -- try it out and send me some feedback.</p>
