<p>Indeed, this is not a simple problem. For simplicity, let's assume that there are no parallel line segments.</p>

<p>First determine the plane where your convex polygon is in. Then detemerine the intersection of that plane with the pyramid. This results in a second convex polygon.</p>

<p>Now you should find the intersection of the two convex polygons. How this can be done, you can find <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2272179/a-simple-algorithm-for-polygon-intersection">here</a>.</p>
