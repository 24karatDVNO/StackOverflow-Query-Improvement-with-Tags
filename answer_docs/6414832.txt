<p>+1 on the other Heroku and Capistrano answers.</p>

<p>Outside of that, I'm particularly looking forward to seeing what VMWare's <a href="http://cloudfoundry.com/" rel="nofollow">CloudFoundry</a> has in store for us. One step deploys (and upgrades) very similar to Heroku, and you can actually host your own clouds if you want to. It's still in beta, but looks pretty slick from what I've been following of it. Supports Ruby (Rails, Sinatra, et al), Node, Java, and others.</p>
