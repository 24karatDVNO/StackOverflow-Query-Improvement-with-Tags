<p>I didn't quite understand your question but If you ask what commands give to the ballgiven its position here is my guess:</p>

<pre><code>1. you find the location of the ball.
2. you have the line of the desired path drown on the board and detected
using canny.
3. Find the closest point to the ball which is on the path line.  If
it was a straight line then the calculation is simple geometrical
formulae dist(point,line). Let us call the result D.
4. The resulting point on the line is where the ball should be. 
5. Advance distance D along the path line. This would give you your
destination point.
6. Subtract ball coordinates from destination point, and then, using atan2()
method to calculate in which direction to move the ball.
7. Activate motores to tilt board in that direction.
</code></pre>

<p>Clarification to step 5. Why did I say to advance distance D along the path? Because thus you direct the ball in at most 45 degrees of the path line. This gives you relatively smooth motor movement.  </p>

<p>If I didnt understand your question please tell me and I will correct my answer</p>
