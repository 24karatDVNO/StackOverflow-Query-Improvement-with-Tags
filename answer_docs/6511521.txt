<p>I think you want to adjust the Item Level Permissions setting of the list. (List Settings->Advanced Settings) </p>

<p>The form in SharePoint States:</p>

<p><strong>"Item-level Permissions
Specify which items users can read and edit. 
Note: Users with the Manage Lists permission can read and edit all items. Learn about managing permission settings."</strong></p>

<p>There are settings for Read access and Create and Edit access:</p>

<p><strong>Read access:</strong>   Specify which items users are allowed to read<br/>
-Read all items <br/>
-Read items that were created by the user</p>

<p><strong>Create and Edit access:</strong>   Specify which items users are allowed to create and edit<br/>
-Create and edit all items<br/>
-Create items and edit items that were created by the user <br/>
-None</p>
