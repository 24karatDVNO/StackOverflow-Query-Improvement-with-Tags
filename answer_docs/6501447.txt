<p>You would need to register in Apple Developer's program ($99 via Fax after online registration) at <a href="http://developer.apple.com/programs/register/" rel="nofollow">http://developer.apple.com/programs/register/</a> and get Key for your device to test your apps in the device.</p>

<p>I have tried to do everything online. But Apple online store does not support direct payment. Hence, they ask to fax registration and card (for payment) details and it would take another week or so before you get the final confirmation via email.</p>
