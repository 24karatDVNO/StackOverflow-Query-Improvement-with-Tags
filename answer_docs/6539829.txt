<p>Like Nikit and Paul pointed out, opening the page in order for the strings to be processed and added to the translation table is an option, but if you have many theme files there is a module that precisely scans a folder for translatable strings and builds a POT file so you can translate all those strings easier and faster. I'd highly recommend you <a href="http://drupal.org/project/potx" rel="nofollow">http://drupal.org/project/potx</a> and <a href="http://www.poedit.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.poedit.net/</a></p>
