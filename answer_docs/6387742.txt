<p>I prefer to have php as a “background” language, but you can go in and out of php on the page.  You can also “fake out” the URL so that a user doesn’t know you’re on a php page.  I also like to use AJAX to make sure that the page doesn’t have to refresh to display database information to the user.</p>
