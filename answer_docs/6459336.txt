<p>You're essentially looking to make an asynchoronous call to your php script once the page is loading, so JavaScript is your friend.</p>

<p>When the page loads, include the loading message and the temporary gif, then do an ajax call to your php script and insert the response into the relevant div.</p>

<p>As @Sjoerd points out - jQuery will do this for you nicely.</p>
