<p>The most recent TaoFramework doesn't have DevIL binding in its sources.</p>

<p>I searched, and I found an older version of Tao, previsely <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/Tao" rel="nofollow">here</a>. From there, you can compiler Tao.DevIL library, which requires DevIL 1.6.8 RC2, which you can find it <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openil/files/DevIL%20Win32/1.6.8%20RC%202/" rel="nofollow">here</a>; download the binary, or compile your self the project from the sources.</p>

<p>Make to sure have the DLL in you path.</p>

<p>If you want to run on Windows, I suppose you shall modify the sources in order to point correctly to the DLL file; if running on 64 bit platform, I suppose you shall point to the 64 bit version of DevIL.</p>

<p>(You're lucky, I've investigated just right now).</p>
