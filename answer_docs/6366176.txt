<p>If you want to invoke an operation on a Service from an Activity, there are two options. One is to create an Intent with any data set as extras on the Intent, and then start the Service kind of like you have done in the code. Then in the Service's onStartCommand, pull out the extras and invoke the appropriate method on your Service. For this option, you probably want to use an <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html" rel="nofollow">IntentService</a>. The other option is to bind to the Service and directly invoke methods on it. To do this you will need to declare your Service's operations using AIDL. See the <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service.html" rel="nofollow">API documentation on Service</a> for details.</p>
