<p>DO you want to fire any event only in case of full time and part time and in case of select you dont want anything to happen.
If this is what you want</p>

<pre><code> $('#dropdownname').change(function () {
        var dropdownValue = $(this).val();
        if (dropdownValuetoString().length &gt; 0)
        {
            Your Code here.........
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>dropdownname is the name of dropdown dropdownValue is what I m getting from dropdown list when index is changed.
I was filling the dropdown from a list and I was not using any value field 
when u check the dropdownValue for select It will show blank and I m sure ur dropdown select list will always have a name.
Tell me if it helps you else I will try something different</p>
