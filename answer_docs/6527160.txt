<p>I <strong>strongly</strong> suggest you to don't use an anchor tag for that. JavaScript events can be added to any DOM element, just like in:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;li class="click-to-expand"&gt;
  &lt;img src="..." /&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And also, as some users already replied, you can use CSS pointer property to indicate a possible user interaction when hovering the clickable interface item.</p>

<pre><code>.click-to-expand{
  cursor:pointer;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Remember to keep it accessible by providing a valid URL to access the content in case it's necessary (no javascript fallback).</p>
