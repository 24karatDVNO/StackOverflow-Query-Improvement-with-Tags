<p>If you are using arrays, you would need to deal with figuring out inserted/deleted rows. If you are dealing with a larget set of data, then you should consider using Core Data with <code>NSFetchedResultsController</code>. See <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/CoreData/Reference/NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate_Protocol/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/intf/NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate" rel="nofollow">documentation for NSFetchedResultsControllerDelegate</a> for getting inserted/deleted rows.</p>
