<p>Your 'maximum' size really depends on a lot.</p>

<p>Your audience:</p>

<ul>
<li>What type of connection do they have</li>
<li>What load time are they expecting</li>
<li>What content are they expecting</li>
</ul>

<p>Your content</p>

<ul>
<li>What content are you trying to present</li>
</ul>

<p>The functionality</p>

<ul>
<li>How does your site load the content</li>
<li>Do users need to move through the site and fetch multiple pages regularly or are there large pauses before they move</li>
</ul>

<p>For any site though, keep your page as small as possible. Good design is about taking things away until you're left with what you need. The base HTML should be a few kb, the CSS a few kb, and if you're loading scripts and images load them last.</p>

<p>With a smaller page, your site loads faster, which means your users feel more engaged and your page gets indexed better.</p>
