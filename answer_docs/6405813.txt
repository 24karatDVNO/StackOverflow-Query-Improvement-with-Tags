<p>If you want a simple implementation then don't divide the application up into two processes. Performance-wise this is not an issue, but you are adding an order of complexity above what is required in a single application. You would need to have an extremely good reason for dividing the application into multiple proceses to overcome the time and effort that it will cost for you to deliver the same functionality with this architecure.</p>
