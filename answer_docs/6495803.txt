<p>Whatever logging method you use, do something like this.(Hand typed may not compile)</p>

<pre><code>try
{
  DoignStuff();
}
catch( Exception ex)
{
Trace.WriteLine( "Exception in &lt;Page Name&gt;  while calling DoingStuff() Ex:"+ ex.ToString() );
}
</code></pre>

<p>It will start with the page name &amp; method (which is redundant, but makes life easier)
then it will convert the EX to a string which shows call stack and all kinds fo other good stuff and put it in the log file</p>

<p>Note: you have to Type the name of the page in the place of <code>&lt;Page Name&gt;</code> .</p>

<p>Log4Net and Elmah are great to make life easier too.</p>
