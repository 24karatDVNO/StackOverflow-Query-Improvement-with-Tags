<p>I would recommend you to use CI for development. Initially it might be hassle to port your code from normal php to CI. That too done properly won't be much hassle.</p>

<p>Once you will move to CI, your code will be organized, then you can enhance features in future. It will make your task very easy.</p>

<p>If you only want to move to CI just to add facebook connect. There is not much difference adding faceebook connect in normal php or CI.</p>
