<p>As the other answer suggests a lookup table is a much cleaner solution.</p>

<p>Regarding your code:
You terminate leaf nodes with NULL... now, when you charToMorse, this code will terminate search even though you haven't checked the whole tree:</p>

<pre><code>else if(current == NULL) 
    return "";
</code></pre>

<p>So, when you do a recursive call verify the returned value and terminate only if you have actually found the letter.</p>
