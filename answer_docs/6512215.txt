<p>Sorry that this is not an answer, but I am not good enough to actually leave a comment.</p>

<p>It looks like there is a bug in your second function.  Your code won't work correctly for queries that return more than one row.  Shouldn't that return statement be:</p>

<pre><code>while($stmt-&gt;fetch()) {

    //to dereference
    $row_copy = $parameters;
    $return_array[] = $row_copy;

}
</code></pre>

<p>And then the function should end with:</p>

<pre><code>return $return_array;
</code></pre>
