<p>Yes, you can achieve a considerable speedup using unsafe.  There's no reason for the line setting <code>joined</code> to take 6%, and the loop condition can also be improved.  Try:</p>

<pre><code>int row = 0;
int remaining = 269440/2;
fixed (ushort* p = (ushort*)&amp;ntscOutput[0])
    do {
        int joined = *p;
        p++;

        // ...

    } while (--remaining &gt; 0);
</code></pre>
