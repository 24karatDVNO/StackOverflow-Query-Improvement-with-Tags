  <p>(besides doing it manually with events)</p>

<p>It must be clarified that one and two way data binding <strong>does</strong> depend on events. Please read about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms743695.aspx" rel="nofollow">How to: Implement Property Change Notification</a></p>

<p>That said, you can databind without hard coding strings representing property names in your code.</p>

<p>One way to do it is through custom attributes. You can decorate certain properties in your data model you want your user control to bind to. This way when the <code>DataSource</code> is set in your user control, via reflection you can search the <code>DataSource</code> object for custom <code>Attribute</code> decorated properties and bind to them:</p>

<pre><code>public class MyDataModelObject
{
    public int NotBindableProperty { get; }

    [MyBindableAttribute]
    public string BindableStringProperty
    {
        get {...}
        set {...}
    }
}
</code></pre>
