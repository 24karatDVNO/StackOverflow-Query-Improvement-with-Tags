<p>I'm surprised nobody suggested computed column.
I do agree with Aaron re normalising data structure. One column should not have 2 dimensions and a type. This should be 3 columns. This should not be allowed in database.</p>

<p>As for computed column - this will save on triggers. 
In SQL Server, go into table, modify column QTY and set "Computed Column Specification" to desired function.
