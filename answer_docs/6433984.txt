<p>have you tried Pypi? There are several libararies/packages and I am sure you can find something.  <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi</a></p>

<p>as Gerrat suggested if you are using a framework then it might have something as well. If not the Python packages are your best bet to find what you need. If you cant find in either of these places, there are code snippet section for your framework of choice or the python sites.</p>

<p>so you have several choices. All you need to do is jfgi ^^</p>
