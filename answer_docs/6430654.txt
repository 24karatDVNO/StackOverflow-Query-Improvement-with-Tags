<p>I have the same problem. The only solution I have found at this time is to delete all repositories (or switch them to enabled=false) from all the dependencies (3).</p>

<p>They should put all these repositories into a profile, this is terrible solution. It would be even alright if there was any response from the server, but it simply hangs. Timeout settings are also ignored.</p>
