<p>IIRC; as a general matter in D, symbols in different files can't overload because the full name of a symbol includes the module name (file name) making them different symbols. If 2 or more symbols have the same unqualified name and are from 2 or more files, attempting to use that unqualified symbol will result in a compile error.</p>
