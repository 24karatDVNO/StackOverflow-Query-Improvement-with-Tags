<p>I believe that the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_meta_box" rel="nofollow">add_meta_box</a> function does not function the same say the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_action" rel="nofollow">add_action</a> function.  The add_action reference states that it takes a callback but the add_meta_box function states that it takes a string that it uses as a callback.  While the argument is named 'callback' it does not state that it will take any php callback as the add_action one does.</p>
