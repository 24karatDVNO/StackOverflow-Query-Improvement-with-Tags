<p>In this blog post, the author describes how he used a LINQ expression parser provided by Microsoft to generate Binding Converters on the fly that actually run a bit of code to transform their input values.  Unlike PyBindings, you need to explicitly bind in the values you are going to use as variables in your expression, but the LINQ syntax seems far better suited for coexisting with the XAML's XML syntax.</p>
