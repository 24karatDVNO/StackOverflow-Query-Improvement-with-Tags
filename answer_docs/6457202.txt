<p>Basically all normalization methods in Bioconductor are based on the AffyBatch class. Therefore, you have to read your textfile (probably a matrix) and create an AffyBatch manually:</p>

<pre><code>AB &lt;- new("AffyBatch", exprs = exprs, cdfName = cdfname, phenoData = phenoData,...)
</code></pre>
