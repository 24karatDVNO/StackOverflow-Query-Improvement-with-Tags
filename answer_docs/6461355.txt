<p>Make sure you're using relative paths to get the url and not absolute, if you go to <a href="http://mydomain.com" rel="nofollow">http://mydomain.com</a> and it tries to get the proxy url from <a href="http://www.mydomain.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mydomain.com</a> (www. subdomain) a security error will be thrown.</p>
