<p>Please see facebook's documentation related to stream.publish <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/rest/stream.publish/" rel="nofollow">here...</a></p>

<p>Quoting from the documentation it is possible to publish to the application's profile page if </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to use stream.publish to post
  on the Wall of your application
  profile page (your application's About
  Page), all the following conditions
  must be true: The posting user needs
  to grant the application the
  publish_stream extended permission.
  The posting user must like the
  application's profile page. A
  developer of the application must edit
  the application profile page's Wall
  Settings (Edit Application > Edit) and
  verify under Posting Ability that Fans
  can write or post content on the wall
  is checked.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Anyways since this api is being deprecated, you should use the new js sdk instead. Please see the documentation <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/javascript/FB.ui/" rel="nofollow">here..</a></p>
