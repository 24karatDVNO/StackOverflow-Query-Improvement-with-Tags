<p>You will have to handle viewController B's view in landscape by yourself. Since viewController B has been added as a subview, its view controller will not be handling its landscape orientation. The <code>UIModalPresentationFullScreen</code> style (landscape and portrait) will work only if viewController B is shown, ie not as subview but as a full view itself. </p>
