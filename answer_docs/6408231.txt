<p>Eclipse is plugin based IDE and these plugins may not like each other sometimes. It will be better to use more installations. In fact if you are developing Java and PHP you will need only 2 of them.
STS is a good Java toolkit especially if you work with spring.</p>

<p>If you new to Eclipse you should know that it can go crazy couple of times per month if you install too much and it is very annoying to see that one day your webapp is deploying and second day no... </p>

<p>Keeping installation separated you will have better control.</p>
