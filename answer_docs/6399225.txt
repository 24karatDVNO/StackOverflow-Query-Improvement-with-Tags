<p>You should be able to create a subset with mapreduce (using 'out'). The problem is mapreduce has a special output format so your documents are going to be transformed (there is a JIRA ticket to add support for another format, but I can not find it at the moment). It is also going to be very inefficent :/</p>

<p>Copying a cursor to a collection makes a lot of sense, I suggest creating a ticket for this.</p>
