<p>Thank you very much for your posts! I found that I have to add a rule to make it work. Also I added touch to be able to repeat the makefile.</p>

<pre><code>progs = prog1 prog2 prog3

all: run_touch $(progs)

run_touch:

    touch *.cpp

%:%.cpp

    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -o $@ $&lt; $(LDFLAGS)
</code></pre>
