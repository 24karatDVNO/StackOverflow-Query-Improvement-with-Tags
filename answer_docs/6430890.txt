<p>Here is one approach which I had done in one of previous projects.</p>

<p>Just append the row to tbody. Give index to each row as a data attribute. Grab the data values of the column on which you want to sort the able in the form of any array of object as shown below. </p>

<pre><code>var trs = [['data', 0], ['data', 1]];//0, 1 are the row indexes before sort.
</code></pre>

<p>Sort this array by providing a custom sort method. After sorting you can loop through this array and append the rows to the same table.</p>

<pre><code>var tbody = $('tbody', fromYourTable);
$.each(trs, function(index, tr){
      //find the row by using tr[1] which contains the index in the unsorted table
      tbody.append(tbody.find('tr[index="'+tr[1]+'"]'));
});
</code></pre>
