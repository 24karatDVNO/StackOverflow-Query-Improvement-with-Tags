<p>@aporat has good advice, though sometimes switching workspaces is pretty slow.  I tend to check out multiple branches in the same workspace, overriding he name in te .project file at checkout- usually by appending the branch name.</p>

<p>Be sure to close any copies you're not actively working on- will save resources on your workstation.  </p>
