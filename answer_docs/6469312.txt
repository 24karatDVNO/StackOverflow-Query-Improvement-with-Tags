<p>It depends on your target platform. The smallest addressable memory unit is 1 byte (8-bits) on x86. That being said, you can design your language to manipulate individual bits of a byte much like C and C++ bit fields do. However, under the hood the compiler needs to generate some fancy bit operations at the byte level to twiddle those bits.</p>
