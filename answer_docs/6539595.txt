<p>I expect a subquery (or several) is in order.  </p>

<pre><code>select location, (select count(total)  
                  from totalTable
                  where totalTable.location = locationTable.location) as total,
                 (select count(uniqe)
                  from uniqeTable
                  where uniqeTable.location = locationTable.location) as uniqe,
                 (select count(missing)
                  from missingTable
                  where missingTable.location = locationTable.location) as missing
from locationTable
where locationCriteria = searchCriteria
</code></pre>

<p>You can reference the same table in multiple subqueries, if necessary - just try to join them on ids, preferrably on something that's properly indexed.  Obviously the where clauses will have to be adjusted as necessary.</p>
