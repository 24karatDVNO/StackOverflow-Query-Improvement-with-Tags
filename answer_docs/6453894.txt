<p>I was experiencing similar problems when requesting valid JSON from the server.</p>

<p>My server was serving the content-type of text/javascript</p>

<p>I was not using the optional jQuery.ajax setting of 'dataType' so jQuery was interpretting the output a javascript (eg padded JSON), not neat JSON.</p>

<p>Adding a dataType:'JSON' to the settings object passed to jQuery's ajax method solved the problem.</p>
