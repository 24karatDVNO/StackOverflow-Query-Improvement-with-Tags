<p>You will need to define a protocol for this class and add a variable of that protocol to the member variable of this class as follows:</p>

<p>The classes where the object is created can either call this method using the object. The Best option is to use the app delegate class to implement these methods. </p>

<p>You can then assign the objects's delegate as the app delegate and call the methods.</p>

<pre><code>@protocol mySqlDelegate ;

@interface mySqlClass  {

    id &lt;mySqlDelegate&gt; delegate;
}
@property (nonatomic, assign) id &lt;mySqlDelegate&gt; delegate;
@end



@protocol mySqlDelegate 

- (void) delegateMethodsForThisClass;

@end
</code></pre>
