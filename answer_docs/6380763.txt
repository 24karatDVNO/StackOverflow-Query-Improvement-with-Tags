<p>jQuery Mobile (JQM): <a href="http://jquerymobile.com" rel="nofollow">http://jquerymobile.com</a> is a framework which does just that. At its simplest, it renders "standard" html elements as native OS elements for platforms like iOS and Android.</p>

<p>You don't have to use the JQM framework, of course; you could simple take what you need from the CSS that JQM employs. Either inspect the css directly or write a simple test page which loads JQM and inspect the CSS in Firebug or Chrome developer console.</p>
