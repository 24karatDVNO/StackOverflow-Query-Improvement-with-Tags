<p>if you do move your config.php file outside of your www, you may have a openbase_dir issue, which what will not allow that script to be processed as a php file (only on certain server configs.. I think that moving your config file outside of the www folder is unnecessary as long as it is not echoing all that info out. </p>

<p>Keep in mind that if your server is processing php files correctly your server will not reveal the file content to the world.</p>

<p>so:
1) Keep it in the www folder
2) I set mine to 644</p>

<p>take a look at this for some more security info:
