<p>The issue seems to have been that the app thought it was in Portrait mode even though I had the .xib in Landscape mode.</p>

<p>Fixed it with this little trick in the viewDidLoad of the mainProjectViewController:</p>

<pre><code>CGRect landFrame = self.view.frame;
landFrame.size.width = self.view.frame.size.height;
landFrame.size.height = self.view.frame.size.width;
self.view.frame = landFrame;
</code></pre>
