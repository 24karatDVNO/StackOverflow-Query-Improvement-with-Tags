<p>There is a nice project here: <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/systemhotkey.aspx?df=100&amp;forumid=12637&amp;exp=0&amp;select=663478" rel="nofollow">System Hotkey Component</a></p>

<p>This project allows your application to sit in the system tray/notification area and fires off an event whenever a hot key of your choosing is detected. In addition, its written in C#. Using this project, making what you are trying to make should be simple.</p>
