<p>I don't know if you have any control over the content being rendered in the browser, but if you do, IE lets you use META tags to force the browser into a rendering mode of a specific IE version. More info at MSDN <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#SetMode" rel="nofollow">right here</a></p>

<p>Also, further down the page there are instructions on how to set up your web server to tell IE which mode to use when it's requesting the page. (If that is of any use to you)</p>

<p>Unfortunately all information I can find on the subject (and I did a comprehensive search for my own project) indicates that there is no such option, or at least not in the general release 
of IE.</p>

<p>Here's Microsoft's "official"
