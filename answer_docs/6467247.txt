<p>If you are moving to a POSIX compliant system (like QNX or Linux), you might want to try adding code in your application to catch <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGFPE" rel="nofollow noreferrer">SIGFPE</a> and handle the condition there.</p>

<p>Not know what language you are using, and (more importantly) not having worried about catching signals in a long time, I'm not sure exactly how you would add the code, but perhaps the answers to this question (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/618215/how-do-i-catch-system-level-exceptions-in-linux-c">How do I catch system-level exceptions in Linux C++?</a>) will help.</p>
