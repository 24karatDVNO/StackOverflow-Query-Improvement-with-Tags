<p>I really doubt that you can do that. Afterall these are primitive datatypes, with emphasis on primitive! 
adding a constraint will make the type a subclass of its primitive state, thus extending it.</p>

<p>from wikipedia:</p>

<p>a basic type is a data type provided by a programming language as a basic building block. Most languages allow more complicated composite types to be recursively constructed starting from basic types.</p>

<p>a built-in type is a data type for which the programming language provides built-in support.</p>

<p>So personally, even if it is possible i wouldnt do, since its a bad practice. Instead just create an object that returns this type and the constraints (which i am sure you thought of this solution).</p>
