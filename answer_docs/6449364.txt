<p>If you are interfacing a USB device then check out the new USB development tools in the Android 3.1 SDK</p>

<p>Android JNI can be used,  but it is not as powerful as a kernel module.  However, you also don't need root to install it.  It really just depends on what type of hardware you are trying to support.</p>
