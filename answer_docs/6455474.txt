<p>I don't think there is something native to go this route. </p>

<p>And it does seem like you are trying to stretch array use a bit. </p>

<p>You should go OOP on this one. </p>

<p>Create a FoodFamilly object and a Food object in which you can store arrays if necessary and you'll be able to write a nice user-friendly code and add indices if needed.</p>

<p>OOP is almost always the answer :)</p>
