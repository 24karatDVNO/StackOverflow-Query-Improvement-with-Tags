<p>The best way to keep the equivalent of shared libraries in the IDE is to use the USER_LIBRARIES. </p>

<p>Create USER_LIBRARY and reference them in the class path for each of the projects that needs them.</p>

<p>As mentioned by the others, runtime (WAS) is different from the development (RAD). </p>

<p>HTH</p>
