<p>Most games use the BACK key for this.... See <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.0.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/sdk/android-2.0.html</a></p>

<p>Note that, while there is a key event ESCAPE (as Ezeh points out), that is only available at API level 11 (which is Android 3.0 and above - <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/api-levels.html" rel="nofollow">http://developer.android.com/guide/appendix/api-levels.html</a>), which is not very widely available in devices yet.</p>
