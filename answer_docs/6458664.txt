<p>If I'm understanding your question correctly, you would like the parent page to create a modal window and place it over top an iframe. Assuming iframe source is pointing to the same domain, you can simple place your <code>fullScreenChart</code> function in the parent page and call it from the iframe like this:</p>

<pre><code>parent.fullScreenChart();
</code></pre>
