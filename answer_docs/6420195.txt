<p>Take a look at the <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/signal.html" rel="nofollow">signal module</a>. If you invoke a signal to a python script, from my understanding if there is a handler for it will first process that signal, and potentially has the ability to handle and ignore certain signals. ie. instead of killing on a SIGKILL, you attempt to perform some shutdown cleanup work before killing. </p>
