<p>You would need to adjust the height and width accordingly:</p>

<pre><code>function mouseOver()
{
var img1 = document.getElementById("img1");
img1.src ="images/p2.jpg";
img1.width = "";
img1.height = "";
}
function mouseOut()
{
var img1 = document.getElementById("img1");
img1.src ="images/p1.jpg";
img1.width = "90";
img1.height = "110";
}
</code></pre>

<p>These days, though, it's really much more recommended to use CSS as Emil suggested.</p>
