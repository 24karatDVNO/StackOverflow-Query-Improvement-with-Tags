<p>From my limited experience, Vim's tabs are not at all the same as in firefox or kate or textmate or, well, any other app. They don't represent files and you should not use them like that. Like actionshrimp said, tabs are more like views or perspectives and you can't have a window (like NERDTree) detached from a tab.</p>

<p>While keeping that distinction in mind you could try to detect the creation of a tab and launch NERDTree. This way you may have file explorers on every tab but these file explorers would be x instances of NERDTree, not 1 instance. I think that would lead to memory problems quickly.</p>

<p>I have one tab for each project I'm working on. That's consistant with what I think is the idea behind tabs and is tremendously helpful for staying organised. </p>
