<p>Pipes don't support SQL type storage directly, it's all 'flat file' or JSON so conversion to and from may be an issue for the final use of the data client side.</p>

<p>They do have small storage pockets than can be accessed via the <strong>YQL module</strong> each has a maximum capacity of 100k and you can have 1000 of them for free.</p>
