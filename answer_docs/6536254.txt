<p>Turning lazy-loading off would prevent them from loading. Turn lazy-loading on and mark all navigation properties as virtual, this will allow them to be overridden so that dynamic proxies can be created. This will allow lazy-loading to work properly. Explicit loading is also an option (and considered by many to be better coding practice).</p>

<p>Edit: Oh I thought it was code first as well, excuse me. Then, if it helps, since Include returns a query object, you can actually loop through a list of them and add them to themselves to build your query dynamically.</p>
