<p>At the very least it looks as if you are missing an <code>NS_DECLARE_STATIC_IID_ACCESSOR(IMYPROGRAM_IID)</code> in your interface (xpidl would have generated that for you automatically.) Some of the other errors are a bit harder to figure out without source code, but the chances are that you haven't quite managed to update your module registration code correctly.</p>
