<p>The problem lies within the CSS, when calling dropShadow() for the first time the css for class dropShadow is set to hiddent (this was placed there to make the dynamic pieces work in IE (all other browsers fine without it).  In the javascript you can see this by the  $('.dropShadow').css('visibility','visible'); being called.</p>
