<p>An alternate idea if you're worried about missing data files... If at any point your app looks for a file and it doesn't exist, throw an exception, pass it to a handler that shows a dialog and 'verifies' your data. You can keep a list of all needed data files, and then only download ones that don't exist. Something like a system check, if you will.</p>

<p>That way they don't end up downloading 50MB if they were only missing a couple files they accidentally deleted in root explorer ;-)</p>
