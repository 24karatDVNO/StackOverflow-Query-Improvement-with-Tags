<p>As a few of the other answers have pointed out (I'm just posting this as an answer because it seemed kind of silly to make it a comment), what you've given in your first code block is <strong>exactly what the contents of your script should be</strong>. You don't need to do anything special to get the <code>r</code> there. In fact the 'r' is not part of the string, it's part of the code that makes the string.</p>
