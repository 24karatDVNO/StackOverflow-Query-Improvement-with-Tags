<p>Semantically, you're actually best off setting up your content like this:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id="main"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sidebar" id="sidebar-left"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="sidebar" id="sidebar-right"&gt;
...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend this technique over the others for a few reasons. My main reason for choosing this method is that by doing this, your content actually starts loading <em>before</em> your sidebars do. There are also some benefits to SEO that you gain from placing your Content before your sidebars.</p>
