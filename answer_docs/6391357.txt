<p>As you found it often pays to measure but I what I think your manager may have been referring to is somthing like this.</p>

<p>This is typically much faster</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SomeFields FROM oelinhst_sql
WHERE
  datetimeField &gt; '1/1/2011'
  and
  datetimeField &lt; '2/1/2011'
</code></pre>

<p>than this</p>

<pre><code>SELECT SomeFields FROM oelinhst_sql
WHERE
  Month(datetimeField) = 1
  and
  year(datetimeField) = 2011
</code></pre>

<p>even though the rows that are returned are the same</p>
