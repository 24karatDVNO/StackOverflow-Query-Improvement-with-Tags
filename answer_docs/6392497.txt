<p>Constants are useful when writing huge programs, where you may get lost and forget what a variable (or constant) does or whether you are allowed to change it's value or not.</p>

<p>Moreover and more important, It's important in teamwork and in writing libraries for others. If you write code for others, they may change a variable you intend to keep with constant value, so declaring it as constant is much useful.</p>

<p>Also it's useful when you want to use the same number in places where only constants are allowed, for example, delcaring static arrays. In this case you cannot determine the size of the array with a variable, also it's very annoying to review all the code and change the number everytime you want to change the size of the array, so declaring that number as a constant is very useful and I really had an experience with it.</p>

<p>Hope that's convincing, that's what I remember for now, I will come back and edit should I remember something else.</p>

<p>Have a nice programming :)</p>
