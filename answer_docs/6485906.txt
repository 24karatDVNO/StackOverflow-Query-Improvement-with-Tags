<p>Can you post the related code segments?  Without that, it is difficult to guess what the problem is.</p>

<p>Page flicker could be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Page load firing twice in update</li>
<li><p>Timer firing when not intended </p>

<p>The list goes on...</p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are unable to post the code, I would troubleshoot by removing everything but the core functionality until you can get the flicker to stop then add pieces back in.  That is really all I can offer you without the code.</p>
