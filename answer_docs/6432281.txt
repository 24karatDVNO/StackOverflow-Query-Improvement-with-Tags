<p>CSS expressions only work in IE 6-7, but allow inline JS to be used (generally to calculate a value to set).</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>/* set bgcolor based on time */
div.title {
    background-color: expression( (new Date()).getHours() % 2 ? "#B8D4FF" : "#F08A00" );
}
</code></pre>

<p>however, this could potentially be used to do malicious things, i'd say it's at least worth some testing.</p>
