<p>The answer...in case anyone else needed help with this...turned out to be as simple as creating a custom page-template, replacing the loop with a hook to your own function and handling all of the requests by parsing the url.  this worked for me, but not well enough to stay with WP, so I wrote the application in an MVC framework.</p>
