<p>Ruby crashing and burning like this isn't much of a problem to me. You get an error, you google about it, ask Stack Overflow, or use some other gem, or do something different. The main thing I worry about is the language giving you incorrect information - for example, splitting a string incorrectly.</p>

<p>I've found that JRuby and Rubinius have been guilty of the mistaken information kind of bugs, but I've never encountered MRI or YARV doing that. Rubinius examples: <a href="https://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/issues/505" rel="nofollow">505</a> and <a href="https://github.com/evanphx/rubinius/issues/513" rel="nofollow">513</a>, and a JRuby example is <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JRUBY-5641" rel="nofollow">5461</a>.</p>

<p>I've been working on the <a href="https://github.com/agrimm/small_eigen_collider" rel="nofollow">Small Eigen Collider</a> to detect inconsistencies and segfaults in the different implementations.</p>
