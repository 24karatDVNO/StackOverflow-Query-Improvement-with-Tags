<p>Since this is 09' answers and whatnot I figure I update the link and code here for anyone looking in 11'.</p>

<p>The link for the Quartz Demo is: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/QuartzDemo/Introduction/Intro.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#samplecode/QuartzDemo/Introduction/Intro.html</a></p>

<p>and the code I use to draw multiple lines is:</p>

<pre><code>   //Drawing lines

    // Set the color that we want to use to draw the line
[ [ UIColor brownColor] set];

    //Get the current graphics context (pen)
CGContextRef currentContext = UIGraphicsGetCurrentContext();

    // Set the width for the line 
CGContextSetLineWidth(currentContext,
                      5.0f);

    // Start the line at this point
CGContextMoveToPoint(currentContext,
                     20.0f,
                     20.0f);
    // And end it at this point 
CGContextAddLineToPoint(currentContext,
                        100.0f,
                        100.0f);

    // Extend the line to another point
CGContextAddLineToPoint(currentContext,
                        300.0f,
                        100.0f);


    //Use the context's current color to draw the line
CGContextStrokePath(currentContext);
</code></pre>

<p>I recommend reading <a href="https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1449305679" rel="nofollow noreferrer" rel="nofollow noreferrer">Graphics and Animation on iOS: A Beginner's Guide to Core Graphics and Core Animation by Vandad Nahavandipoor</a>. It's mostly on graphics than animation though. I recommend checking out his videos on animation if your interested. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybMFPB-Gbsw&amp;feature=player_embedded" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybMFPB-Gbsw&amp;feature=player_embedded</a> They're called <em>Animations in iOS using Block Objects</em> Part I and II. Supposedly there are supposed to be more videos at some point. But the videos go with the book.</p>

<p>That's it.</p>
