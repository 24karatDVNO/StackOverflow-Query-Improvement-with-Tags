<p>You can do it , But with complex image processing, gesture recognition and machine learning algorithms. 
And the response of the system should be real-time if you want to win that game which naturally makes your research complex.</p>

<p>But  if the original game is developed by yourself , then you probably don't need any of image processing, ,webcam and FRAPS. In that case all you need is Machine Learning for game playing.</p>
