<p>So we ended up implemented a different solution that while the results were not as good as using an INDEX, it still provided a nice speed boost of around 25%.</p>

<p>We remove the JOIN and instead used an ORDER BY subquery:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * 
FROM `table_a`
WHERE table_a.col = 'value'
ORDER BY (
   SELECT date 
   FROM table_b 
   WHERE id = table_a.id
) ASC
LIMIT 0,20
</code></pre>
