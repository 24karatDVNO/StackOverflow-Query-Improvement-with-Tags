<p>There is a pretty good jQuery Slider called Coda-Slider 2.0. It has an autoplay function and can cycle through things cyclicly as well.</p>

<p>The plugin itself doesn't look to difficult to decipher so you could probably add a pause/play  button and then write some extra javascript like interval to tell it to resume after a set period of time. Not sure if this is exactly what you need but check it out.</p>
