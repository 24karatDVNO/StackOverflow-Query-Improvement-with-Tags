<p>Are you running your page in a framework? Do you use sessions? </p>

<p>Php doesn't store any information about the page or user object unless you tell it to.</p>

<p>If you however have an object with userdata you can simply access it like this</p>

<pre><code>print_r($userObj);
</code></pre>

<p>And if there are some data in and userId property you might access it like this</p>

<pre><code>$userObj-&gt;userId
</code></pre>
