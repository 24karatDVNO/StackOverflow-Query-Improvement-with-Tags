<p>You can create custom log with Apache to track the number of bytes transferred. The difficult part will be associating that to a given user. Probably a combination of cookie and maybe remote IP.</p>

<p>You would then take that log and process it in the background.</p>

<p>S3/Cloudfront can provide similar logs, but you probably wont be able to associate it to a user.</p>
