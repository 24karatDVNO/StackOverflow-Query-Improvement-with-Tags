<p>I'm sure there are others too. I have to admit, I tried a few Eclipse-based UML modelling tools a couple of years ago when I had need of UML. I ended up using a separate free UML modelling tool as the Eclipse based options were very complex and seemed a bit unreliable, but things might be better now.</p>
