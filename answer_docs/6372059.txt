<p>I've seen similar errors before.  A couple things to check:</p>

<ul>
<li>Look in the directory containing p4php and verify that you see "README.txt" and "RELNOTES.txt"</li>
<li>Remove the brackets from around <code>&lt;C:\p4api&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If none of that works you can always contact Perforce support.  They can help troubleshoot.</p>
