<p>It is not possible, because <strong>client-side script</strong> can NOT interact directly with <strong>server-side script</strong>, therefore it requires you to have a "transporter" in the between, which is AJAX. Have a look at <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" rel="nofollow">jQuery AJAX</a>, it's tiny, sweet and powerful.</p>

<p>But assume there is a small chunk of information, and it's not very confidential, I can suggest you to do this way, using cookies. People don't usually take advantage of cookies.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
document.cookie = 'info='+information; expires=Mon, 19 Jul 201110:00:00 UTC; path=/';
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>In PHP file</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
if (isset($_COOKIES['info'])) {
   $information= intval($_COOKIES['info']);
}
?&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Once you finish getting the information, you can delete that cookies.</p>
