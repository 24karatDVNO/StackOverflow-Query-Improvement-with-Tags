<p>As far as I know, no. What you <em>could</em> do is to query all of your SCVMM servers and see which happens to know the guest.</p>

<p>Load up the VMM module and connect to your VMM.</p>

<pre><code># VM name, might or might not be hostname
$guestToLook = "myLostVM"
# A list of all of your VMM servers
$VMMServers = @("vmmsrv01", "vmmsrv02", "vmmsrv03")
$VMMServers | % {
    # Connect to VMM server
    Get-VMMServer $_
    # Get a VM from the VMM host by guest name
    $vm = Get-VM -name $myLostVM
    # If VM object is returned, you got the VM from current VMM host.
    if($vm.Name -eq $myLostVM) { "{0} is managed by VMM host: {1}" -f $vm.Name, $_}
}
</code></pre>
