<p>There is no sure shot method of identifying the alt+f4 method of browser as it is happening client side and onunload will be called every time the page will be refreshed, even if you click a link or do a refresh. Instead, you can use a timeout function in javascript, that will call a server side page every 2-5 minutes and you can check the state in your server side code. If the page is not called within the defined time frame, it means that the user has closed the session and you can call <code>Session.Abandon()</code> there.</p>
