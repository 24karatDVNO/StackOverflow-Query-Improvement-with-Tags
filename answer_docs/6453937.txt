<p>I'd first recommend running the Magento DB repair tool to see if you have any botched database tables. If not, try turning on the error log in Magento and see if you can get more detail on the query (or at least where in the stack it is generated).</p>

<p>If you get really desperate, turn on query logging in MySQL and take a look at the query directly to see what's going wrong.</p>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Thanks,
