<p>Quoting from the deprecated <a href="http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/designing-with-opera-mini-in-mind/" rel="nofollow">Opera website</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>International text and fonts</p>
  
  <p>Opera Mini supports internationalization, including the full range of character sets supported by Opera in addition to Unicode. However this is dependent on font support in the phone which commonly is limited. Bidirectional text is not supported in Opera Mini.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So it looks like boils down to font support for Indic scripts, but for your Hebrew and Arabic needs you will probably be disappointed.</p>

<p><em>Edit:</em> According to a quick internet search, there is an option <code>use bitmap fonts for complex scripts</code> in <code>opera:config</code> which allows some sort of server-side rendering of complex scripts.</p>
