<p>The thing is, that you have to pre-load the 'dt' with the configuration in the Excel-file, in order for the TableAdapter to work out. This is as far as I know. There's many paths you can take, including first creating columns and then loading row-by-row, or loading the Excel-sheet in as a DataTable itself and add this to a DataSet.</p>

<p>Suggestions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start using CamelCase programming notation. This really helps out and prevents errors.</li>
<li>Read up on ADO.NET, for example by following some tutorials.</li>
<li>Drop OleDb handling, ADO.NET suffices.</li>
<li>Realize the differences between VB.Net and VB6, and prepare to learn some more object-oriented programming</li>
</ul>
