<p>If you are using "yellow folders" then they are not actual folders. They only serve the purpose of organizing your files in XCode. And second, you should use the normal iPhone image in interface builder and it will automatically locate the @2x image, so if you are using the "blue folders" and separating the images, I think it probably will have a hard time understanding that it should look in "standard" when it is on a non-retina screen and "retina" when it is a retina screen, because you never never told it to do that.</p>
