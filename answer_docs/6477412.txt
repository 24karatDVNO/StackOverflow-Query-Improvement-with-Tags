<p>If you're creating a mobile version of a current app that has existing data sources etc theoretically the only thing you should have to change is your front end to be suitable for a mobile browser.</p>

<p>In the end you web server will still be serving the pages as if it was any other normal browser (except it would just be the mobile version), and have the same access to resources (eg. databases0 that the standard site does.</p>

<p>In terms of "the cloud" there is no reason that you need to really host anything in there (web/data server) but if you site ends up getting large and/or you don't want to worry about managing infrastructure issues etc investing in the cloud may be a good idea, there is plenty of reasons to go to the cloud but for what you are trying to achieve it is not a necessity.</p>
