<p>You can easily manipulate CSS in Javascript. For example, this jQuery snippet changes the background colour of an element when condition 'x' is true:</p>

<pre><code>if(x) $('#test').css('background-color', 'green');
</code></pre>

<p>â€¦ that's very simplistic of course: it would be far better to change the relevant element's <em>class</em> to something else, and define the various class styles in your CSS.</p>
