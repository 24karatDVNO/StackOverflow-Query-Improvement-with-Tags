<p>It is not advisable to use variable names that conflict with reserved keyword but sometimes you may want to not follow that rule for readability.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>        var duplicates = from item in Items
                         group item by item.Name into @group
                         where @group.Count() &gt; 1
                         select @group;
</code></pre>

<p>It kinda highlights the important part of code.</p>

<p>Other cases come to mind when you need to use third party code that you cannot change.</p>
