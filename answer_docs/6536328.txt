<blockquote>
  <p>Decimal degrees are an alternative to
  using degrees, minutes, and seconds
  (DMS). As with latitude and longitude,
  the values are bounded by ±90° and
  ±180° respectively. Positive latitudes
  are north of the equator, negative
  latitudes are south of the equator.
  Positive longitudes are east of Prime
  Meridian, negative longitudes are west
  of the Prime Meridian. Latitude and
  longitude are usually expressed in
  that sequence, latitude before
  longitude.</p>
