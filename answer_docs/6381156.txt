<p>Some options would be:</p>

<ol>
<li>write a crontab job to process the files and update a 'processed' field</li>
<li>write a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/http/file-uploads/#writing-custom-upload-handlers" rel="nofollow">custom upload handler</a> (advanced)</li>
</ol>

<p>I would go with option 1 for potentially lengthy/slow operations. The #2 is interesting if you already have mad^H^H^Hgood Python skills.</p>
