<p>I see this is mvc application=>
your solution would lie in routing(for me_)</p>

<p>you know every option which is not marked as [nonaction] is registered in Global.asax
which contains </p>

<pre><code>  AreaRegistration.RegisterAllAreas();
  RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
</code></pre>

<p>and in this routes you will be able to find all accessible methods =>eg actions</p>

<p>this is created in basic mvc</p>

<p>Hope this will help</p>
