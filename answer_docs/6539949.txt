<p>Transferring local log entries to a central database can be a hard job to do. You have to handle all possible exceptions, interruptions etc. For that reason i would suggest considering a solution using SQL Server Compact 4.0 with Microsoft Sync Framework.</p>

<p>I think it is possible to implement a one-way service oriented synchronization solution.</p>

<p>In addition SQL Server Compact 4.0, has a DB size limit of 4GB and handle >250 concurrent connections. Also you have the option to include x86 and x64 bootstrapper packages with your click-once applications.</p>
