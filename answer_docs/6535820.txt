<p>Can you just add these properties to the listview?</p>

<pre><code>ScrollViewer.CanContentScroll = "True" 
ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility="Visible" &lt;!-- or "Auto"   --&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Everything else looks ok to me.  You have the 3 rows, 2 of which are absolute, the other stretching. You also have the listview in the 2nd row, so it should stretch with it.</p>

<p>if that doesn't work, try wrapping the ListView in a scrollviewer</p>

<pre><code>&lt;ScrollViewer&gt;
    &lt;ListView/&gt;
&lt;/ScrollViewer&gt;
</code></pre>
