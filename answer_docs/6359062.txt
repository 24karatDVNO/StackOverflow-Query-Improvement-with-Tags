<p>I think you need to reshape your grids, griddata expects a list of points with coordinates in column form:</p>

<pre><code>points = transpose(reshape((X,Y), (2,12)))
pointsI = transpose(reshape((XI,YI), (2,12)))
Z = reshape(X**2+Y**2, 12)

print scipy.interpolate.griddata(points, Z, pointsI)
</code></pre>
