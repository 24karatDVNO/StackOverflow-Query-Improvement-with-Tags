<p>In C# both works in the same way. I think you are thinking if you handle the exception (rather than throwing it), how to get rid of executing the second statement?</p>

<pre><code>void SomeFunction() 
{     
   if (key.Length != Dimensions)     
   {  
       throw new KeySizeException(); //Halt the execution of SomeFunction method
   }
      SomeOtherFunction(); 
} 
</code></pre>

<p>If you handle and do not want to execute SomeOtherFunction, you can just return as below.</p>

<pre><code>void SomeFunction() 
{     
   if (key.Length != Dimensions)     
   {  
       HandleMyException(); 
       return;    // Returns and halt the execution of SomeFunction method.
   }
      SomeOtherFunction(); 
} 
</code></pre>
