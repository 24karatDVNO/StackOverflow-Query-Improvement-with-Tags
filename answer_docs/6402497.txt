<p>You should take a look at the <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/NotePad/index.html" rel="nofollow"><code>Notepad</code></a> application provided with the android sdk. In this application there is multiple activities (<code>NoteEditor</code> and <code>NotesList</code> for example) and multiple layouts (<code>note_editor.xml</code>, ...).
If this doesn't help, feel free to ask for a more specific question (for instance what XML are you talking about).</p>
