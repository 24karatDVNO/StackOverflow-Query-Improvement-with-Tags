<p>An easy way might be to use an installer such as winzip self-extracting executable (<a href="http://www.winzip.com/prodpagese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.winzip.com/prodpagese.htm</a>) to do the job.  i.e. write a batch file that executes the 5 files in the desired order and set it as the target to run when the extractor completes.  the end result is you have one exe that runs all 5 batch files in order. </p>
