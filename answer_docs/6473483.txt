<p>To my understanding, the check - if any - is performed at "library level", where the local types are translated into Thrift types, where the code generation happens. In other words, it will depend on the bindings for the specific language you are using (PHP, Erlang, whatever), to raise meaningful - or not - errors if types are not respected. But I have to look into it a bit more.</p>
