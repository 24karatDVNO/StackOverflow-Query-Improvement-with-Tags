<p>Not at my current job, but in the past I used a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff678491.aspx" rel="nofollow">database project</a> in Visual Studio 2010, which was then published to SVN. We had an SOP rather than software automation to push changes from development to QA, staging, and production.</p>

<p>The team I worked with was small - five developers with shared responsibility for DB design and .NET development.</p>
