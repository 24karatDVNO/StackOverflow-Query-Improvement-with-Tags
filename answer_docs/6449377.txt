<p>Have your main window controller pass the search query or filter predicate to a property of the content view controller.</p>

<p>You can give the main window controller a weak-referencing (<code>assign</code>) property that holds the current content view controller. Implement a custom setter that not only assigns to the backing instance variable, but also does the swap. That, any time it's time to do a swap, you simply say <code>self.currentContentViewController = viewControllerToSwapIn</code>, and when it's time to change the query/predicate, you pass it to <code>self.currentContentViewController.searchQuery</code> (having implemented the <code>searchQuery</code> property in the MainContentViewController class and made all your actual content-view controllers inherit from that class).</p>
