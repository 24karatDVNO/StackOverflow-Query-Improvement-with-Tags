<p>I think you are trying to ask if the google web crawler will crawl (follow) that link.
I really don't know that but i expect it would.
However if it does not you can always use:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;a style="display:none;" href="www.stackoverflow.com" /&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And it will crawl that (at least it did on some of my pages).</p>
