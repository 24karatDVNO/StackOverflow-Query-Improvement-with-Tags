<p>I'm not great with perl. But,</p>

<pre><code>for $m ( keys %a ) {
print "sum(@{$a{$m}}) = sum(@{$b{$m}})\n" if exists $b{$m};
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>Modify this line to count the number of elements in set $a and $b for each $m. When you've finished looping through all of them, select the one with the least number of elements.</p>
