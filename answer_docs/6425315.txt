<p>It's hard to answer your question because you've not provided any code or other way for us to determine what might be going on for you.</p>

<p>At a guess, I'm going to say that the main content div on your page is extending (in width) and forcing the sidebar to drop underneath.</p>

<p>You can test this by making your main content section slimmer and see if the right hand bar decides to shift back into place.</p>

<p>As for why this might only be happening in Chrome and not other browsers, it's hard to know without more information.</p>
