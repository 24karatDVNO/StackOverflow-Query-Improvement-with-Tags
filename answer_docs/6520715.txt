<p>There really is effectively no difference. Even <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_statements.asp" rel="nofollow">W3Schools</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The example above is not very useful.
  It just demonstrates the use of a
  block. Normally a block is used to
  group statements together in a
  function or in a condition (where a
  group of statements should be executed
  if a condition is met).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So you would more often use a block in something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
if (someValue==true) {
    document.write("&lt;h1&gt;Executed block 1&lt;/h1&gt;");
} else {
    document.write("&lt;h1&gt;Executed block 2&lt;/h1&gt;");
}
&lt;/script&gt;
</code></pre>
