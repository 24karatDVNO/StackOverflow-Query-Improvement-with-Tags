<p>The bottom line is that often a XmlParseException is actually a TargetInvocationException which can be determined in the InnerException. That could be an anchor for further investigation. </p>

<pre><code>try
{
}
catch(Exception ex)
{
}
</code></pre>

<p>construct and set a breakpoint at the catch. Then inspect the ex variable in greater detail to see if it contains a InnerException that may give you more insight.</p>
