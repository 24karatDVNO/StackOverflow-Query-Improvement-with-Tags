<p>You have included an IP address in the VirtualHost directive. Did you provide a compatible NameVirtualHost directive using that IP address along with the port? If you didn't then likely that the VirtualHost configuration isn't being used at all, and instead the default virtual host definition is being used and it is that which is set up to return the index. More often that not using an IP address in VirtualHost is not what you want to do and you should just use '*:8080', still remembering though that you need a matching NameVirtualHost directive.</p>
