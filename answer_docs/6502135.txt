<p>it seems that online in this context means "available for scheduling" and based on what i read in <code>include/linux/cpumask.h</code> where <code>num_online_cpus()</code> is defined. i'd think it would be possible for it to return different values at different times but in any stable system i don't think it would commonly do so.</p>
