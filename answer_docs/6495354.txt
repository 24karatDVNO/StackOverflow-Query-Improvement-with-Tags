<p>You can use <code>eval</code> -</p>

<pre><code>for item in locals():                # although locals() is a dict, you can iterate through its keys.
    obj = eval(item)
    print type(obj)                  # this prints the type of the object
    if isinstance(obj, someclass):
        # do something
</code></pre>
