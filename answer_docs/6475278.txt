<p>One way to get a tree-like interface effect is to use buttons and formatting rules to create collapsible sections by hiding them conditionally.</p>

<p>For example you have a plus button and a minus button next to each other. The plus button sets a ShowSection field to 1, the minus button sets it to 0. When the field value is 0, rules hide the section and the minus button. When the value is 1, a rule hides the plus button. The end user experience is to press the plus button to see what's below it, and press the minus to make it disappear. </p>

<p>The tree effect comes when you start putting one collapsible section inside another recursively.  </p>
