<p>as suggested by Josh Caswell, you can do it by placing as many buttons needed on the main view or any view and just assign the tag values in the IBOutlet and the tag value differentiates the buttons in your case. in your case you need almost 15-18 buttons i guess.using IB will reduce your work</p>
