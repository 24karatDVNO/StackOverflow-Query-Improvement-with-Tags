<p>@louis; From my point of view use <code>position:absolute;</code> for a hole layout is not good. there are several reasons.</p>

<p>1)<code>absolute position</code> div not consider height &amp; width which when means you resize your page then the elements are overlapping each other. Which mesh the page.</p>

<p>2)suppose you have <code>vertical divs</code> with same <code>class</code> like <code>panel</code> . Then if you give them </p>

<pre><code>.panel{
position:absolute;
top:20px;
}
</code></pre>

<p>then what happens  all divs take <code>top:20px;</code> from top of page &amp; overlapping each other. Absolute position
made everything is outside of the normal flow of layout.</p>
