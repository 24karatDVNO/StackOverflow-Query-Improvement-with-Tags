<p>There is the entity that corresponds to the unique human being:</p>

<pre><code>     EMPLOYEE
     eeid PK
     firstname
     surname
     dateofbirth
     dateofhire
     dateoftermination
     etc
</code></pre>

<p>and there is the entity that corresponds to the position(s) held by the employee:</p>

<pre><code>     EMPLOYEEPOSITION
     id pk
     eeid FK references EMPLOYEE(eeid)
     title
     reportsto FK references EMPLOYEE(eeid)
     startdate not null usually
     enddate allows null
</code></pre>

<p>The question of how to enforce whether an EMPLOYEE's positions can overlap is not typically addressed by creating multiple EMPLOYEE records. Inserts/updates to EMPLOYEEPOSITION typically look at the startdate/enddate columns for each of an EE's positions and, depending on what rule is in effect (e.g. overlaps allowed/disallowed) either commit or rollback the operation.</p>

<p>All of an EE's positions can be found using eeid. </p>

<p>You do not usually put a termination date in the EE record unless and until it's necessary.  If the EE is a contract worker, I'd instantiate the contract term as an EMPLOYEEPOSITION.</p>

<p>You can analogize from here for any entity that exists in a many-to-one relationship back to EMPLOYEE.</p>
