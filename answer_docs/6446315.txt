<p>It looks like your issue is that AddressValidateResponse is the root node of your document. </p>

<p>You should change it to:</p>

<pre><code>var address = from a in xDoc.Descendants("Address")
                  select new AddressBlockResponse
                  {
                      // stuff
                  };
</code></pre>

<p>Also when you are using xelements like</p>

<pre><code>City = a.Element("City").Value,
</code></pre>

<p>You should do:</p>

<pre><code>City = (string)a.Element("City"),
</code></pre>

<p>because if the element doesn't exist your program will throw a null reference exception.  I know you will probably always have these xml nodes but I think it is just a good habit.</p>
