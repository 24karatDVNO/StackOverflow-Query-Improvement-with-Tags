<p>The first index isn't defined within the scope of the for loop, that's why it cannot be re-declared outside the for loop. Inside the for loop, however, is the only place the first index can be accessed, because of how the compiler works.</p>

<p>Just rename the index outside the loop to index2.</p>

<p>To recap, both index's are in the same scope, one is just accessed in a different scope.</p>
