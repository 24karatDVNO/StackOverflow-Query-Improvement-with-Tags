<p>Just make a new <code>confirmation.php</code> file and then redirect if file uploaded successfully.</p>

<pre><code>if(move_uploaded_file($_FILES['uploaded']['tmp_name'], $target)) 
{
header("location: confirmation.php");
} 
else {
echo "Sorry, there was a problem uploading your file.";
}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope it will help you.</p>

<p>cheers..!!</p>
