<p>I think gcc developers has a good reason for this behaivor. Remember, a static function do not have a "this" pointer, and when it is being actually called, the caller do not required to pass the "this" pointer. So this is a small performance optimisation when it is actually nothing contained in the closure object. And you can see the G++ developer leave you a way to workaround by declaring the lambda expression as "mutable" (remember you actually do not have anything to mutate).</p>
