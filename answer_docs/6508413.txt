<p>I would recommend you use this Library, <a href="http://allseeing-i.com/ASIHTTPRequest/" rel="nofollow">ASIHTTPRequest</a>, which is like an extended version of the NSURLRequest. I have been using it to download images for later display, asynchronously. It has a nice CACHE implementation which saves bandwidth and loading times on your app. </p>
