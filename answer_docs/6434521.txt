<p>"This directive is used to specify diverse options to the compiler. These options are specific for the platform and the compiler you use. Consult the manual or the reference of your compiler for more information on the possible parameters that you can define with #pragma.</p>

<p>If the compiler does not support a specific argument for #pragma, it is ignored - no error is generated."</p>

<p>So, according to this, you'd have to look up the documentation for your compiler to see what that specific option does, due to this the best way to look up pragma information on the internet would be based on the compiler you use.</p>
