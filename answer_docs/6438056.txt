<p>if you are using xcode4 don't slide the framework in the project: it edit the framework search path and do the error you describe.
 Try deleting the framework search path in project "build setting" and for adding the framework use "target" "build phase" "link binary with library".</p>

<p>hope it help and sorry for my poor english.</p>
