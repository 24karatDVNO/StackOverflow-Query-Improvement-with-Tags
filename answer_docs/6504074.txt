<p>Of course, adding <code>{$DEFINE MYCONDITION}</code> in your code would add a custom directive which you could check with <code>{$IFDEF MYCONDITION}</code> but this you should already know. However, if you compile your project from the <a href="http://docwiki.embarcadero.com/RADStudio/en/DCC32.EXE,_the_Delphi_Command_Line_Compiler" rel="nofollow">commandline</a> <code>DCC32 -D MYCONDITION ...</code> then you can compile it with (or without) that option.</p>
