<p>So far I have ended up using a seperate build step in TeamCity that executes a bat script that  in turn fires of tasks to the list of machines using <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx" rel="nofollow">PsExec</a>.  So far my trial runs it is working ok, though I now need to parallelize the copying of build output...</p>

<p>Thanks for the input to those who have provided it.</p>
