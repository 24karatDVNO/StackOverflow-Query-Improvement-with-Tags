<p>// Edit: Tool was already mentioned in another answer, so give all credits to Kuryaki.</p>

<p>Just found <a href="http://www.supose.org/wiki/supose" rel="nofollow">SupoSE</a> which is a java based command line tool which scans a repository to create an index and afterwards is able to answer certain kinds of queries. We're still evaluating the tool but it looks promising. It's worth to mention that it makes a full index of all revisions including source code files and common office formats.</p>
