<p>You could sort by recent votes. So newer drawings that are getting votes now will sort ahead of older drawings. A lot of sites have multiple "Top" lists, arranged by time frame. Like "Top this week," "this month," and "all time."</p>

<p>If you can only have one "top" list, then you could "age" the older drawings. So a drawing that has 10 votes but is a month old might get an age multiplier of 0.8, whereas a new drawing would have a multiplier of 1.0.</p>
