<p>You can set all your secret constants in a config/initializers/01_secrets.rb file. Here are a few things to think about: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>The 01 prefix is to make sure that
the secret constants are set before other
initializers that make use of these
constants are loaded. </p></li>
<li><p>The 01_secrets.rb file should not be
checked in to your SCM.</p></li>
<li><p>The server(s) that store this file
must be properly secured and the file
itself should have maximum security.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code># config/initilizers/01_secret.rb
ENV['ENCRYPTION_KEY'] = "your_key"
</code></pre>
