<p>Something like the following should achieve the effect you're looking for. Keep in mind I haven't run or tested this code.</p>

<pre><code>class Bar &lt; ActiveRecord::Base

  has_many :foos, :dependent =&gt; :destroy, :after_remove =&gt; :delete_orphan

  def delete_orphan(foo)
    foo.destroy
  end

end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Switched to a more specific callback</p>
