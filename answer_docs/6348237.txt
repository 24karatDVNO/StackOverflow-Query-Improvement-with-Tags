<p>Fixed. Adding CSS style position:relative to the footer div fixed it. But I still don't know why it would append the last three ( if >= 3 chars) or the whole thing if the string is exactly three chars outside of the footer div, and would still act as though is the same link.</p>

<p>Anyone could care to explain what that is or if it's just some sort of known IE6 bug?</p>
