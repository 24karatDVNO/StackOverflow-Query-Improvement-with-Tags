<p>The problems are arising because your Table2 is not really a 'vehicle' table. Because the VehicleId does not uniquely identify a record in that table. This is where all of the confusion is coming from. So to solve that and get your problem to work I did a select distinct on table2 against the values in table 1 (I also did a select distinct for clarity, but it was not necessary.) Hope this helps.</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE #Table1 (Id INT)
CREATE TABLE #Table2 (VehicleID INT, Value VARCHAR(50), Table1ID INT)

INSERT INTO #Table1 VALUES (1),(2),(3),(4),(5)
INSERT INTO #Table2 VALUES (1, 't', 1),(1, 'q', 2),(3, 'w', 3),(3, 'e', 4),(4, 't', 1),(5, 'e', 1),(5, 'f', 2),(5, 'g', 4)

SELECT * FROM #Table1
SELECT * FROM #Table2

SELECT  t2.VehicleID, t2.Value
FROM    ( SELECT    t2.VehicleId, t1.Id
          FROM      ( SELECT DISTINCT
                                VehicleId
                      FROM      #Table2 ) t2
                    CROSS JOIN ( SELECT Id
                                 FROM   #Table1 ) t1 ) Base
        LEFT JOIN #Table2 t2
            ON Base.VehicleId = t2.VehicleID
               AND Base.Id = t2.Table1ID
WHERE (Base.VehicleId BETWEEN 1 AND 3)

DROP TABLE #Table1
DROP TABLE #Table2
