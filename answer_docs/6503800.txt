<p>The great thing about Django is, that there is code for nearly every common programming problem, that you can download and use in your own project. (and most of the django packages are quiet well written too) </p>

<p>for pagination check out <a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-pagination" rel="nofollow">http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-pagination</a></p>

<p>it's really easy to install and setup, so you do not have to think about pagination and focus on coding your software!</p>

<p>hope this helps, Anton</p>
