<p>I understand what you mean/need but I don't think is possible. Are you expecting the IDE to add another attribute when you add one or nUnit to know what a category is and apply certain extra attributes for tests of certain categories?</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea but in case sounds more like nUnit configuration rather than pure c# attribute chaining which I am not aware of if exists.</p>
