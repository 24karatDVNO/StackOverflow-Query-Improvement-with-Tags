<p>SSRS in 2011/2012 is actually code named "Denali".  Project Crescent is the code name for a new ad-hoc report building/self-service BI tool that leverages Reporting Services.</p>

<p>AFAIK, they cannot release a new version of the control with Denali because it will be out of band with the IDE release (Visual Studio), since VS and SQL have different ship cycles, and the Report Viewer controls ship with VS.</p>

<p>We'll probably have to wait until the next version of VS to get a updated version of the Report Viewer controls for SQL Server "Denali".</p>
