<p>I think you are missing the classpath entry.</p>

<p>You probably want to include you sql-driver directy in the class folder "fatjar" or "uberjar": <a href="http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://one-jar.sourceforge.net/</a></p>

<p>This will create a single jarfile, which can be executed directly.</p>
