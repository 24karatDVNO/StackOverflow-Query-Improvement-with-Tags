<p>is the "do something" part of the code actually doing something? Otherwise, you may just want to decrement by 100 instead of by 1.</p>

<p>Otherwise, try the following</p>

<pre><code>$account_id_new = 147887000;
while($account_id_new &gt; 2) {
    if($account_id % 100 == 0)
       echo " this is 100th time";

$account_id_new = $account_id_new-1;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>
