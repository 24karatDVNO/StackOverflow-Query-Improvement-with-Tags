<h2>bad</h2>

<p>Original code is repetitive, and copy-pasting code is dangerous ( <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2490884/why-is-copy-and-paste-of-code-dangerous">Why is &quot;copy and paste&quot; of code dangerous?</a> ):</p>

<pre><code>print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines."

line1 = raw_input("line 1: ")
line2 = raw_input("line 2: ")
line3 = raw_input("line 3: ")

print "I'm going to write these to the file."

target.write(line1)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line2)
target.write("\n")
target.write(line3)
target.write("\n")
</code></pre>

<p>Much shorter, can change it to 4+ lines just by changing one character:</p>

<pre><code>print "Now I'm going to ask you for three lines."

lines = [raw_input("line {i}: ".format(i=i)) for i in range(1,4)]

print "I'm going to write these to the file."

for line in lines:
    target.write(line+'\n')
</code></pre>
