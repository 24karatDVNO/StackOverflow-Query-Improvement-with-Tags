<p>You should use the new way (AVCaptureInput), as only a few percent of users still use iOS 3.  iOS adoption is much faster than android adoption.  Early last winter about 90% had already upgraded to 4.  At this point even 4.0 is likely in the small minority as well.</p>

<p>One pre-ios-4 way to do it was by opening a UIImagePickerController and taking screenshots.  Depending on the exact version targeted, there are sometimes ways to disable the camera overlays.</p>
