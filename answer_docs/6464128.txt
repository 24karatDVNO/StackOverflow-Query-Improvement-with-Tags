<p>You can use <code>NSSplitView</code> to do that. You can have more than 2 subviews in a split view (left|center|right) and you can build a kind of hierarchy for the different bars (center consists of top and lower split views).</p>

<p>The show/hide effect is not built in, though. But you should be able to use the <code>animator</code> to do that. Most certainly you can also define animations for hiding a view.</p>

<p>You could also use the <code>BWSplitView</code> of <a href="http://brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/" rel="nofollow" title="BWToolkit">http://brandonwalkin.com/bwtoolkit/</a> where the show/hide animation is already included.</p>
