  <p>Can I use float ... rather than using position: absolute or relative?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Float has limitations compared to absolute or relative positioning. Not every layout which is made by relative or absolute positioning can be made by using Float. But that statement goes vice versa.</p>

<p>And as all answers have stated yet: each has its own purpose, limitations and usage.</p>
