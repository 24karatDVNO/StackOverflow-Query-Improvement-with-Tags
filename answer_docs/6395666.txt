<p>The error is telling you exactly what your problem is: You've made your new verifier variable a "Verifier" variable (whatever the heck that is), and you're trying to assign a String returned from the getValue() method into this variable. So since only you have the code for the Verifier class, you need to check to see if you can somehow add String information to the variable. Does it have a setText(...) method? Would you be better off not using a Verifier variable but rather a String variable? </p>
