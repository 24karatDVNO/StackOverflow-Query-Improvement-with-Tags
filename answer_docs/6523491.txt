<p>the effect you are looking for is "cover flow" (thats what apple calls it)</p>

<p>This looks like a pretty good aproximation <a href="http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jacksasylum.eu/ContentFlow/</a></p>

<p>EDIT: actually I suppose you just want a slider. The one you linked to is kind of crumby to begin with (that unnecesary bounce is terrible). Though I can't seem to find any better ones. May have to make something yourself. If I had a good excuse to, I'd make a plugin myself but I can't spent that kind of time on it. I'll see if I can find anything else.</p>

<p>EDIT2: Actually looking at it I think you can control the scaling on the content flow I posted so you can probably get it to do what you want without too much trouble. </p>
