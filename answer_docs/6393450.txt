<p>Other common problem is the <code>friend class Area;</code> declaration inside the class without a forward declaration first (I'm almost sure this is the case, are you using GCC?)</p>

<p>In Region.h</p>

<pre><code>class Area;  // &lt;- this is a forward declaration

clasee Region {
 ...
 friend class Area;
};
</code></pre>
