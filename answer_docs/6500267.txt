<p>I believe Flash either can't implement the mouse-trail or it is far more difficult than JS. See  this tutorial : <a href="http://www.kirupa.com/developer/as3/dynamic_mouse_trail_flash_pg1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kirupa.com/developer/as3/dynamic_mouse_trail_flash_pg1.htm</a> , where the mouse-trail demo is stuck in a box. I think because Flash is an all-or-nothing app. You can't truly mesh it in with the browser(i.e. Flash doesn't fully work with the DOM).</p>

<p>This is textbook JavaScript though.</p>
