<p>Strings are immutable in python, so your second example can't work. In the first example you are binding the name <code>var</code> to a completely new object on each line.</p>

<p>Typically multiple assignments to a single name like that are a code smell. Perhaps if you posted a larger sample of code someone here could show you a better way?</p>
