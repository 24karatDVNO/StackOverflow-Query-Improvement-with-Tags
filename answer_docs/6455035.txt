<p>Yes! Finally the solution to my problem has hit me. All I need to do is modify my above production to:-</p>

<pre><code>rule:
    RULE user_string '{' buncha_replacements '}'    [* rule(%2, 1) *]
    |
    RULE user_string RATIONAL '{' buncha_replacements '}'  [* rule(%2, 1*%3) *]
    ;

user_string:
    STRING | SCALE ;
</code></pre>

<p>This is a pretty elegant solution compared to what I mentioned in my problem text. If anybody has any better solution then please do comment.</p>
