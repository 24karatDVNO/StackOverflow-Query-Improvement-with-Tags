<p>Heres Apples recomendation for using the UID</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A device’s unique identifier
(sometimes abbreviated as UDID for
Unique Device Identifier) is a hash
value composed from various hardware
identifiers such as the device serial
number. It is guaranteed to be unique
for each device. The UDID is
independent of the device name. For
devices that use a SIM (subscriber
identity module) card, the UDID is
independent of the SIM card.</p>
<p>For user security and privacy, you
must not publicly associate a device’s
unique identifier with a user account.</p>
<p>You may use the UDID, in conjunction
with an application-specific user ID,
for identifying application-specific
data on your server. For example, you
use could a device-user combination ID
to control access to registered
products or when storing high scores
for a game in a central server.
However, if you are developing a game,
you may want to instead use Game
Center’s player identifier key as
explained in Game Kit Programming
Guide.</p>
<p>Important: Never store user
information based solely on the UDID.
Always use a combination of UDID and
application-specific user ID. A
combined ID ensures that if a user
passes a device on to another user,
the new user will not have access to
the original user’s dat</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it looks like if you are using this for storing data on a server you can use the UDID and a ID that you generate. Also it looks like Apple has gotten rid of many of the older ways that you would use to access the phone number.</p>
