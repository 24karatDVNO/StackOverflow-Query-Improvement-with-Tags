<p>Internet is stateless and the server cannot really distinguish you from any other person out there (technically speaking, ignoring sessions and cookies). You are served the content and connection with you is ended. On your new request the things start from scratch. I agree with you that inability to keep an object alive is an overhead, but even bigger overhead would be if million users made a request with a different requests to the same object. Keeping million copies of the same object is next to impossible.</p>
