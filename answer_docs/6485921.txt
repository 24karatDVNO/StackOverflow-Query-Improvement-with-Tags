<p>usually application discover their peers in the same network using <em>UDP broadcasts</em>, maybe thats what you are looking for. this requires the app on the lan to listen on a specified port, the phone (or whoever is looking for that app) sends a udp packet to that port on the broadcast address (255.255.255.255), and the app replies with its individual ip address. not sure if that is what you are looking for and if its possible with android</p>
