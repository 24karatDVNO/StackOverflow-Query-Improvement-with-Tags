<p>FWIW, I'm getting the same behavior with SP2 installed. Several "Pause for Duration" WFAs which should have paused for 3 minutes each have now been waiting for more than 4 days with no error in the workflow, and all timer jobs reporting healthy in central admin.</p>

<p>There's a post about this on MSDN which suggests that the hotfix only fixed part of the problem: <a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sharepointworkflow/thread/1965d387-8436-4868-98dc-7a76cbda75d3/" rel="nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sharepointworkflow/thread/1965d387-8436-4868-98dc-7a76cbda75d3/</a> (that discussion has been locked, thanks MSDN)</p>
