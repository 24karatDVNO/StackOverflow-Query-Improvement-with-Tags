<p>At this level, you're dealing with something the compiler will optimize away anyway.  There may be an additional assignment that occurs in the first that doesn't happen in the second (that would have a negligible impact on performance because you're simply dealing with pointers), but I imagine any compiler worth its salt would turn these two statements into the same assembly.  </p>
