<p>edit: "Deleting" answer since it's tagged node.js, leaving it in case it happens to be useful to anyone else:</p>

<p><strike>The general answer is no, it isn't.  At least not in every browser, so any solution anyone gives isn't going to work in many cases.</p>

<p>There are a few things that can work, but again there is horrible support for them:</p>

<ul>
<li>dom modified events (FF only, I believe)
<ul>
<li>DOMAttrModified</li>
<li>DOMNodeInserted</li>
<li>DOMNodeRemoved</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul></li>
<li>object.watch (FF only)</strike></li>
</ul>
