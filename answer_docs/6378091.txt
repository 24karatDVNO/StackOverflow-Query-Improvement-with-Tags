<p>This isn't possible with Unbound.</p>

<p>Unbound can <em>override</em> external data, but it has no support in its <code>local-zone:</code> <a href="http://www.unbound.net/documentation/unbound.conf.html" rel="nofollow">configuration setting</a>  for synthesising records for a domain only if the originally requested external data can't be resolved.</p>
