<p>Create a HashMap having the characters mapped to the frequency. Also keep a maximum count and increment it when needed. At the end, you have all the frequencies stored and the maximum count. Now iterate over the hashmap and pick the character keys which are mapped to a value equal to maximum count.</p>

<p>Storing = O(n)
Retrieving all the characters with maximum frequency = O(n)</p>

<p>So, both together are done in linear time.</p>
