<p>I believe this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/q/1960957/210774">question</a> has answers that will work for you. I'll post summaries here for convenience.</p>

<p><em>From <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960957/twitter-api-logout/1961377#1961377">Ryan McGeary</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The session with Twitter is defined by
  a cookie owned by Twitter -- something
  you do not have control over. You
  cannot log them out of Twitter on
  their behalf.</p>
  
  <p>If you want someone to be able to use
  your "switch twitter account"
  functionality, you'll need to pass
  them off to the OAuth handshake again,
  but use the <code>/oauth/authorize</code> path
  instead of the <code>/oauth/authenticate</code>
  path. This will allow the user to
  switch their user credentials at
  Twitter during the handshake instead
  of just re-authenticating using their
  existing Twitter session.</p>

<p><em>From <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1960957/twitter-api-logout/1972194#1972194">abraham</a></em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use <code>oauth/authenticate</code> and add
  <code>force_login=true</code> as specified in
  <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/oauth/authenticate" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://dev.twitter.com/doc/get/oauth/authenticate</a>*.
  This will prompt the user with a login
  form.</p>
