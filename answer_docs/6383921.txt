<p>I don't think there is a standard way to do it for every music player out there. At least for the Android music player you could do:</p>

<pre><code>Intent i;
i = new Intent("com.android.music.musicservicecommand");
i.putExtra("command", "pause");
context.sendBroadcast(i);
</code></pre>

<p>Another way to do it would be to set the stream volume for type "music" to 0, and play your announcement on another stream type.</p>
