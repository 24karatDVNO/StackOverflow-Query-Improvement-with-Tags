<p>I noticed that a containing table was enforcing widths, and also the icon set are td's, so there's a minimum width they'll collapse down to, so if you have many icons in a single row - it could be messing all over your widths.</p>

<p>Sort of related SO question of mine, ended up being quite related to your problem: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4489304/able-to-float-td-elements-consistently">Able to float td elements consistently?</a></p>
