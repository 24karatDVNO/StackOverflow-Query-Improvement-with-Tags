<p>This is a side-effect of the callback function being invoked asynchronously. When it is called, <code>this</code> is no longer what you expect it to be.</p>

<p>Saving the current value of <code>this</code> in a variable before you create the callback helps:</p>

<pre><code>var self = this;
function (msg) {
  var container = $(self).parent().attr('id');   
  alert (container); //returns undefined
}
</code></pre>
