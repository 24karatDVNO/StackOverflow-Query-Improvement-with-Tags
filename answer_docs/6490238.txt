<p>If you're reasonably comfortable with ZF you can use a custom route class for this, see this explanation: <a href="http://tfountain.co.uk/blog/2010/9/9/vanity-urls-zend-framework" rel="nofollow">http://tfountain.co.uk/blog/2010/9/9/vanity-urls-zend-framework</a> (slightly different problem there but the solution is the same). For your case you'll want one for companies and one for countries.</p>
