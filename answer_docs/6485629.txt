<p>I haven't tried it, but <a href="http://apache.webthing.com/mod_proxy_html/" rel="nofollow">mod_proxy_html</a> might be able to do this. From the documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mod_proxy_html is an output filter to
  rewrite HTML links in a proxy
  situation, to ensure that links work
  for users outside the proxy. It serves
  the same purpose as Apache's
  <code>ProxyPassReverse</code> directive does for
  HTTP headers, and is an essential
  component of a reverse proxy.</p>
  
  <p>For example, if a company has an
  application server at
  <code>appserver.example.com</code> that is only
  visible from within the company's
  internal network, and a public
  webserver <code>www.example.com</code>, they may
  wish to provide a gateway to the
  application server at
  <code>http://www.example.com/appserver/</code>.
  When the application server links to
  itself, those links need to be
  rewritten to work through the gateway.
  mod_proxy_html serves to rewrite <code>&lt;a
  href="http://appserver.example.com/foo/bar.html"&gt;foobar&lt;/a&gt;</code>
  to foobar
  making it accessible from outside.</p>
