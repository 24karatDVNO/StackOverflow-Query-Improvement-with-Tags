<p>One of the most popular Andengine games is Chalk Ball Lite which uses such an effect very successfully.   Unfortunately, according to informaation from the developer that I have seen elsewhere on StackOverflow, he had to accomplish this using a "workaround" that created curved paths as a series of rectangles.  Depending on what you will be using these paths for you might be able to either use the series of rectangles methods or possible a series of points/particles.</p>
