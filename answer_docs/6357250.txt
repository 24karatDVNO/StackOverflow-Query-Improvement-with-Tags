<p>something like:</p>

<pre><code>select ref_id,
startdate.log_stamp as start_date, 
max(comment.log_stamp) as latest_comment, 
completeddate.log_stamp as completion_date
from table1 t, 
table2 startdate, 
table2 comment, 
table2 completeddate
where  startdate.ref_id = t.ref_id
and    comment.ref_id   = t.ref_id
and    completed_date.ref_id = t.ref_id
and    startdate.log_type = 1
and    comment.log_type   = 2
and    completeddate.log_type = 3
group by
 ref_id,
startdate.log_stamp, 
completeddate.log_stamp
</code></pre>

<p>You may need an outer join on completeddate and comment if those values aren't always present...</p>
