<p>Well, my first answer would be that a tabbed interface probably isn't appropriate here.  Tab bars are to provide parallel modes of usage (e.g a watch app that shows either an alarm or a timer), not to provide subsidiary information.  You should probably have a button on the mapview that pulls up a modal dialog to change the settings.  That  then uses a delegate pattern to send the changed information back to the parent. See apple's document on Modal View Controllers for sample code.</p>
