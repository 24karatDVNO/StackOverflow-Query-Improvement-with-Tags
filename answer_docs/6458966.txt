<p>I tried this out, adding a little sample text to your div, and got rid of the scroll bar simply by not giving the second div a height, and allowing the broswer (both IE and FF) to figure out for itself what hieght to give it.</p>

<p>However, given your comment to George, I think this may not be your fix either.  Perhaps you could post a little bit more of your code (or psuedo-code) to give at least one typical example of the second div being replaced.</p>
