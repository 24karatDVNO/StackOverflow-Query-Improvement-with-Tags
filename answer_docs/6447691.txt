<p>It is possible if you add an extra variable eg. :active
then your query shoul look something like this.</p>

<pre><code>...
where
(m.name like :manufacturer and 1 = :active) or
(m.name like :manufacturer and a.description like :description  and 2 = :active) or
(m.name like :manufacturer and a.description like :description and a.percentSize &lt;= :sizeMax and 3 = :active) or ...
</code></pre>

<p>And so on...
With the :active you can then later decide which of the arguments should "count".
Or do nothing by setting :active to e.g null.</p>

<p>Do you get the idea?</p>
