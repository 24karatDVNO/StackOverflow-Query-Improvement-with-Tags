<p>Ok that is just so dumb of me, the html did not have a start nor end. As in the example of brian, in code its saying it needs to include javascript in the html. Which it does not do by default. Added 2 lines to my html and the function works</p>

<p>Now i just need an REGEX which checks if an url has an href, if so add function. If not add href and function.</p>
