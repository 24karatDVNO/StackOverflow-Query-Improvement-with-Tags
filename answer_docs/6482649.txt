<p>I don't know what you are trying to do, so I can not tell you which one to use. in principle, servlet is used with JSP(JSF) to implement a MVC architecture. </p>

<p>what you need to do to solve the problem you describe as question is that you need a from like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form action=" /*the url where you get data */ " method="get"&gt;
  &lt;input name="tabledata" type="button" value="getData"&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>and in Servelet you have something like this:</p>

<pre><code> public doGet(httpServeletRequest request, httpServletResponse response){
       String tableData=getParameter("tableData");
       //call the method you have
       if(tableData!=null)showDB();
 }
</code></pre>
