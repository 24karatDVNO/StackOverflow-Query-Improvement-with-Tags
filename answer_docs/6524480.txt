<p>Agree with that there is some 'basic' stuff that you have to understand before creating a game. Think of it as if a game consists of managing the gamestate, keeping all objects, perform interactions, draw screen, use file i/o, work with keyboard/mouse, make objects responsive to the key/mouse, have infrastructure of its own in general. Yo–≥ may be interested in Processing (quite simple, do not have to think of a tonn of unrelated stuff like Windows message managing in C++), based on Java (and actually is Java), can be seen at <a href="http://processing.org" rel="nofollow">http://processing.org</a>. The simple but powerful environment would get you started quickly. Has many one-page example covering the exactly kind things required in games, constant updates and a very friendly community. Later you may go back to C++ or stick with Java, since Processing can be easily plugged into Eclipse providing one of the greatest IDEs and the Java power.</p>
