<p>The simplest way (or hack) would be use a different page layout such that you have you have two web parts (left and right).  On the left webpart, you can put a simple content editor and have a table of specific width % (or assign the width % in webpart properties) such that the right webpart is right-aligned to the browser.</p>

<p>Not sure if there is a way in Sharepoint Designer to set the alignment relative to the browser. </p>
