<p>I have so far found the game <a href="https://github.com/phreeza/cells" rel="nofollow">Cells</a> to be quite satisfying.</p>

<p>The whole object of the game is to program a "hive mind", which is capable of surviving, breeding, and destroying its enemies.</p>

<p>Lots are good "minds" are provided by the author and various contributors, and it's easy to write others by looking at them.</p>

<p>However, the author seems to be progressing on it very slowly - the last commit was about a year ago.</p>
