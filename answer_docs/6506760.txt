<p>The browser can receive real-time updates via BOSH connection to Jabber/XMPP server. All bits and pieces can be found in this book <a href="http://professionalxmpp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://professionalxmpp.com/</a> which I highly recommend. If you can anyhow send XMPP message upon record addition in your DB, then it is relatively easy to build the dashboard you want. You need strophe.js, Jabber/XMPP server (e.g. ejabberd), http server for proxying http-bind requests. All the details can be found in the book. A must read which I strongly believe will solve your problem.</p>
