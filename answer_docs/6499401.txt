<p>As Eric pointed out, worst case scenario is that the interfaces are too granular. This sounds like it's the case. IMO from a purely design perspective it's the same issue as database over-normalization. If you can manage to consolidate many interfaces even where some things are redundant, and if you can do so without loss of manageability, you should.</p>
