<p>Yes and no is your answer. You can write, say, x86 assembly and it will do the same thing on Linux, Mac OS X, and MS Windows ... But by do the same thing, I mean literally it will take data from the same place, perform the same operations and store it back somewhere in memory.</p>

<p>So in this way, you can do fast 3d math or something in the same way on all platforms, but the way you get data into your assembly routine and out of it and what you use it for will be different on all platforms. So you can't "display" hello world on any OS, but you can certainly put the characters "hello world" (or a set of transformed vertecies) into memory somewhere so your OS specific code can pull it out and use it.</p>
