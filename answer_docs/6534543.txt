<p>Family Historian <a href="http://www.family-historian.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.family-historian.co.uk</a> will create exactly what you are looking for, eg one file per person using the built in Web Site creator.  As will a couple of the other Major genealogy packages. I have not seen anything for the RDF part of your question. </p>
