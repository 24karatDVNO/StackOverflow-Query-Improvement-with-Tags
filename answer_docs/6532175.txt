<p>If you can't use .NET 4.0 and are stuck on 3.5/2.0, I wrote a small library called Awesome.ClientID to solve this problem.</p>

<p>I've posted it before in this answer: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5049221/how-do-i-make-this-getelementsbyname-work-for-ie-and-ff/5049299#5049299">How do I make this getElementsbyName work for IE (and FF)?</a></p>

<p>Basically it will allow you to serialize all your controls to a JSON array, and you can change your JavaScript to:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById(controls.ddlInd);
</code></pre>
