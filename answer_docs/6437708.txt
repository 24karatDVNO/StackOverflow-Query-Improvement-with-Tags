<p>I've started off by going into Developer --> Platforms and then deleting the iPhoneSimulator.platform folder.</p>

<p>I never use the iPhone simulator and this folder in both versions of Xcode take up around 4GB <strong><em>each</em></strong> so I thought this would be a good start. </p>

<p>I haven't seen yet whether it causes me any problems elsewhere, but hopefully it shouldn't. </p>

<p>I'm continuing to see what other folders are not necessary and take up a lot of space. </p>
