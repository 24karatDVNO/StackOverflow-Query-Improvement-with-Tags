<p>It <strong>is a recommended best practice to always close the proxy when the client is done
using it</strong>. Closing the proxy releases the connection held toward the service, which is
particularly important to do in the presence of a transport session. It also helps ensure the threshold for the maximum number of connections
on the clientâ€™s machine is not reached.</p>

<p>For the singleton service closing the client proxy will terminate only the transport session, not the singleton context and the instance inside. If the singleton
service supports contracts without a session, those contracts will not be per-call: they
too will be connected to the same instance. By its very nature, the singleton is shared,
and each client should simply create its own proxy or proxies to it. closing the proxies <strong>did not terminate the singleton</strong>.</p>
