<p>I dont have the complete answer, but I can give you a start, as I am attempting to make it work as we speak..</p>

<p>The newest jquery.history.js file does work in chrome:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.serpere.info/jquery-history-plugin/samples/ajax/" rel="nofollow">http://www.serpere.info/jquery-history-plugin/samples/ajax/</a></p>

<p>and, not to be putting down on ajaxify, I have used it for years, but I sometimes think it has been a bit of a crutch for me, not really learning the simplicity of ajax myself since 'Max' did such a sweet job with ajaxify itself.</p>

<p>I am currently just utilizing that little ajax demo from the history.js site itself, for my needs, its working just fine..but I am still trying to get ajaxify back..</p>

<p>It really seems simple, ajaxify is using the old history file, and a history.fixed.js file, and the both use the old style of historyInit() instead of the new history.init(), I spent a few minutes, ok hours, trying to get it to work, but could not, I am gonna give it a try again, but have just put in a email to 'Max' from ajaxify per his site:</p>

<p>but it didnt seem to send..</p>

<p>I will keep you posted!</p>

<p>(hats off to stackoverflow!! thank you thank you thank you for being you!!)</p>
