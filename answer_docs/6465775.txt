<p>are you looking for answers for both c# and java?</p>

<p>As a c-sharper, I prefix with "I" and most c# developers I talk to do also, probably because it's in the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8bc1fexb%28v=vs.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">microsoft naming conventions.</a></p>

<p>However interestingly when search around for java naming conventions I see a mix of prefixed and no prefix.</p>

<p>So in c# perhaps something like:</p>

<pre><code>public interface IUsable {

    void InUse();
}
</code></pre>
