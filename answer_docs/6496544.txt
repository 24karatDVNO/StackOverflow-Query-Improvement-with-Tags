<p>When using a join alias as suggested by psousa, you will get results in a strange combination of an object structure and a row structure, with the top-level objects being duplicated by the child objects that are attached to them.  In order to get the results I was looking for, you can use TransformUsing and a DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer as shown in the following code:</p>

<pre><code>    Site siteAlias = null;
    Event eventAlias = null;

    var results = currentSession.QueryOver&lt;Site&gt;(() =&gt; siteAlias)
            .JoinAlias(m =&gt; m.Event, () =&gt; eventAlias)
            .Where(() =&gt; eventAlias.EventDate &gt; eventDate)
            .Where(() =&gt; siteAlias.StateCd == state || Restrictions.On(() =&gt; siteAlias.StateName).IsLike(state))
            .TransformUsing(new NHibernate.Transform.DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer())
            .List();
</code></pre>
