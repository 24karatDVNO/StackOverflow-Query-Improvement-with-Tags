<p>I assume you want to know whether the user modified any fields when the form is submitted. It would be easiest to use <a href="http://api.jquery.com/data/" rel="nofollow"><code>.data()</code></a> to keep track of which fields have changed from their original value. As other posters have mentioned your code calls <code>.val()</code> redundantly, incorrectly uses <code>==</code> instead of <code>!=</code>, and might not be using jQuery objects correctly.</p>
