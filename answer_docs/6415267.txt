<p>If you want to use <code>WindowState = Maximized;</code>, you should first indicate the size limits of the form maximized by the <code>MaximizedBounds</code> property...</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>MaximizedBounds = Screen.FromHandle(this.Handle).WorkingArea;
WindowState = FormWindowState.Maximized;
</code></pre>

<p>Where are you limiting the size of your form to the work area that is the desktop area of ​​the display</p>
