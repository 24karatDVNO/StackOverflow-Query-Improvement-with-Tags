<p>Colspan sets the number of columns a cell should span. Here you have 3 header cells, the first spanning 2 columns below it, the second spanning 1, and the third spanning 2 (adding up to five columns below the three header cells).</p>

<p>It looks like you want 3 cells on top and 4 columns below, correct? If so you need to make the 3rd header cell be colspan=1 and it will be 76px wide like the column below it. </p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>
