<p>According to <a href="http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki%3aevents" rel="nofollow">http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:events</a>, there's row index property but it doesn't get passed in to onSelectRow event. Perhaps you could get to the row object via its ID and check whether it has a row index, possibly called <em>iRow</em>. From there you'll just have to find the next row by row index iRow+1.</p>
