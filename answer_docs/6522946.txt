<p>I used to get the same thing about 2 years ago. Add a honey pot to your contact form. This is an extra input which is hidden with CSS then in your PHP check that it has an empty value before running your mail script. Honey pots stop spam bots from filling out your forms, I've used this on 50+ sites so far with no problems. Let me know if you want more info on how to.</p>
