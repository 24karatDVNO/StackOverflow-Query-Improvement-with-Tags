<p>it will also require implicit data structures, but you can spawn threads, run them inorder, and make each thread read a line and wait a decreasing amount of time. the result will be: the last thread will run first, and the first one will run last, each one printing its line. (the interval between them will have to be large enough to ensure large "safety margins")</p>

<p>I have no idea how, if any, that can be done with no explicit/implicit data storage.</p>
