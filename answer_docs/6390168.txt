<p>This method worked perfectly (once I added __using System.Collections.Generic;.Once I did that all was fine</p>

<pre><code>public void InitializeDropDown(string XmlFile, string xpath)
{

    string[] services = { "Google Weather", "Yahoo! Weather", "NOAA", "WeatherBug" };

    IEnumerable&lt;string&gt; query = from service in services
                                orderby service.Substring(0, 1) ascending
                                select service;

    foreach (string @string in query)
        WeatherServicesCBO.Items.Add(@string);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now all I need to do is get the values from the XML document into a string array. Thanks everyone for your help (I you know of a way to get the data from XML file into string array share ;))</p>
