<p>So from what I can see this is your problem: "what I have no idea how to achieve is how to have the tabs added with the correct information."</p>

<pre><code>$.get("ajax.php", { name: $(getImageID).val()}, function(data) { 
//get the json array in data var     
     $(this).after("&lt;span class='title'&gt;Title"+obj["title"]+"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class='summary'&gt;"+obj["text"]+"&lt;/span&gt;"); //append a couple of spans with the data after you retrieve the unique data

});
</code></pre>

<p>Firstly your ajax.php page needs to be returning a simple JSON_encode'ed array: <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php</a>, see this for more details.</p>

<p>The next step is when you are appending the new content AFTER the button you pressed, use .after to the documet view: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/after/" rel="nofollow">http://api.jquery.com/after/</a></p>

<p>Here is a quick jFiddle that shows what the JSON encoded array is doing: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/DKuK9/1/" rel="nofollow">http://jsfiddle.net/DKuK9/1/</a> 
it is applying a couple of spans with the arrayed content into the div, not precisly what your script is doing however i do not have a ajax page to call to :)</p>

<p>edit your get function usage was wrong-</p>
