<p>Hans, welcome to SO. You did not specify which version of Excel in your tags, but here are some Excel 2007 solutions.</p>

<p>It is possible (and helpful!) to do this without VBA. You may be interested in this <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/sort-data-in-a-pivottable-or-a-pivotchart-report-HP010175904.aspx" rel="nofollow">Microsoft solution</a>.</p>

<p>I would recommend that you select the range of the pivot table with the totals, exclude the header and the grand total, and then go to the Data tab and choose the Sort Z->A. This will sort the totals in descending order (and of course, change the headers to the left).</p>

<p>You can also record a macro to do this if you would like to perform this sort on a regular basis, but that may be more trouble than it is worth.</p>
