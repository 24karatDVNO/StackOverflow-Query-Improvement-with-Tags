<p>Presumably you're using ajax to make the call to the back end that you're talking about. Use some kind of a chached flat file as an intermediate for the data. Set an expire time of 5 seconds or whatever is appropriate. Name the data file as the query key=value string. In the ajax request if the data file is older than your cooldown time, then refresh, if not, use the value stored in your data file.</p>

<p>Also, you might be underestimating the strength of the mysql query cache mechanism. If you're using mysql query cache, I doubt there would be any significant performance dip over doing it the way I just described. If the query was being query cached by mysql then virtually the only slowdown effect would be from the network layer between your application and mysql.</p>
