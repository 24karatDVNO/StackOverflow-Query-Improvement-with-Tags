<p>Something like this using the BudgetType.  Of course you'd probably create a code table for these or a IsAdopted bit field.  But you get the idea.</p>

<pre><code>Select 
budgets.*
,row_number() over(partition by 
   ProjectNumber
  ,SubProjectNumber
  ,FiscalYearBegin
  ,FiscalYearEnd 
   order by QuarterImportDate) as SequenceNumber
From
(
  Select
  ProjectNumber
  ,SubProjectNumber
  ,FiscalYearBegin
  ,FiscalYearEnd
  ,QuarterImportDate
  ,'Proposed' as BudgetType
  ,ProposedBudget as Budget
  From sourceProposed

  Union

  Select
  ProjectNumber
  ,SubProjectNumber
  ,FiscalYearBegin
  ,FiscalYearEnd
  ,QuarterImportDate
  ,'Adopted' as BudgetType
  ,AdoptedBudget as Budget
  From sourceAdopted
) as budgets
</code></pre>
