<p>This is usually done by storing another ID for each entry in the database. If you don't want to go that route, you'll have to use a function that can convert to/from "public" id's. Like...</p>

<pre><code>function toPublicId($id) {
  return $id * 1498158 + 825920496;
}

function toInternalId($publicId) {
  return ($publicId - 825920496) / 1498158;
}
</code></pre>

<p>or whatever. I sometimes use guaranteed unique alphanumeric ID's for public ID's, converting to/from them by converting to/from for instance base36 and a large multiplier + offset.</p>
