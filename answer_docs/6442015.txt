<p>perhaps you could use a javascript library to encrypt/decrypt datas on the client side, asking the user to enter a passphrase to decrypt datas locally when viewing them, and encrypt them before submission of a form. This way only crypted datas will transit over the network and wihtout the passphrase you only access crypted datas.</p>
