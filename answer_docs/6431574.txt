<p>If you have a growing number of records, your script (and its memory) will reach its limits faster than mysql would. Are you planning to fetch all records anyway?
Mysql would be quicker in general.
I don't get how you would use the value calculated in php in an ORDER BY afterwards. If you are planning to sort in php, it would become even slower but it all depends on the number of records you're dealing with.</p>
