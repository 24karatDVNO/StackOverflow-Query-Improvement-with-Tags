<p><code>#define A B</code> tells the preprocessor (a part of the compiler) to substitude <code>B</code> wherever it sees <code>A</code> in the code, and it does it before compiling the code. You could (although it's a terrible idea) do something like <code>#define FALSE TRUE</code>.</p>

<p>A const variable means that once the variable is set it can't be changed, however it doesn't do anything with the preprocessor, and is subject to the normal rules of variables.</p>
