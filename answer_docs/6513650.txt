<p>It's a good practice don't depend on the some Parent component at all, just image that in the future you decide to paste between child and parent master page some other master page - and you will have a trouble because of the reference to ex-parent master page. </p>

<p>So, in my opinion, it is better to define an event on childmaster page and have an event handler to this event on parent master page. </p>
