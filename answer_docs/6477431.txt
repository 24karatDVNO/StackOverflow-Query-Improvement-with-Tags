<p>You can include the whole method body in your <code>try</code> block.</p>

<p>In your <code>catch</code> part you can have multiple <code>catch</code> blocks to handle different types of exceptions:</p>

<pre><code> @catch (NSException * e) {
   ....
 }
 @catch (OtherException * e) {
    ....
 }
 @finally {
    NSLog(@"finally");
 }
</code></pre>

<p>so you could also discern exactly which line failed based on the specific exception raised, if you ever need it.</p>
