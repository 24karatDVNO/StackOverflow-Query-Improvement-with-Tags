<p>I encounter the same issue.</p>

<p>After some research i found out that there is a similar behaviour in RadioGroup for the setCheckChangeListener.</p>

<p>Tagging messes things up, seems like a bug. </p>

<p>My workaround was setting the tag to null at the end of the listener It worked for me.</p>

<pre><code>private OnCheckedChangeListener checkBoxitemClickListener = new OnCheckedChangeListener() {

    public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton buttonView, boolean isChecked) {


        if(isChecked)
        {               
            //do smth
        }else
        {
            //do smth
        }   

        buttonView.setTag(null);                        
    }
};
</code></pre>

<p>If you need to update your ListView after, don't forget to call "notifyDataSetChanged" on your adapter.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>
