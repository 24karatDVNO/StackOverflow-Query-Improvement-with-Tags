<p>What I understand is that the end user, who reads your mail, reads it in HTML format where as the email is composed in text. Things you can do is to insert line breaks or <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tags for all carriage returns. I would in fact suggest you to use something like PHPMailer which takes care of mos of these things.</p>
