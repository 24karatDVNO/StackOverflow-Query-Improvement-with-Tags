<p>You want to group on singular tag names, not on whole lists of tags, which is what you are currently doing. Try this:</p>

<pre><code>var tags =
    (from p in posts
    from tag in p.Tags
    group tag by tag into g
    select new {Tag = g.Key, Count = g.Count()})
.OrderByDescending(o =&gt; o.Count)
.Take(number);
</code></pre>

<p>Though this should do what you are asking for, it won't fix the compile error you're getting. That's somewhere else.</p>
