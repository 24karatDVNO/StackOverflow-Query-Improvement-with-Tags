<p>I've never used it, just presently doing some research, but I noticed that you have tagged your question with rails-3 and to my understanding, has_many_polymorphs doesn't work with it. I have found the following fork which might help with the error: <a href="https://github.com/jystewart/has_many_polymorphs" rel="nofollow">has_many_polymorphs by jystewart for rails 3</a>.</p>
