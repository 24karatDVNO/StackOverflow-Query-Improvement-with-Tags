<p>well my recommendation, Developer express have some amazing end user criteria builder, you can use theirs.</p>

<p>there are other controls to create end users criteria , like 
<a href="http://devtools.korzh.com/query-builder-net/" rel="nofollow">http://devtools.korzh.com/query-builder-net/</a></p>

<p>I hope that help you</p>

<p>both controls above abstract the data acess layer so your end users wont have access to send a direct query to the database. The controls only build the criteria and its your work to send the query to the database.</p>
