<p>Before you go ahead and deem it a code problem, I'd have your mac user clean his scroll wheel out with either a.) an alcohol wipe or b.) a piece of paper. Rub the mouse ball with the wipe, or apply pressure to it with the paper and roll it back and forth to <code>git</code> any dirt out. I'm willing to bet it is a hardware issue rather than code. </p>

<p>If it is a newer mouse without the scroll ball, then... well, I lost the bet. </p>
