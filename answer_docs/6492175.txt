<p>If you are intending to only store the salary details as 22,000, then you can simply go for a <code>varchar</code> or <code>nvarchar</code> type. However if you are using this column in some analytics or calculation, then either you will need to convert the column datatype in code as and when required. That depends on how many places you will be using or querying for this column for calculation.</p>
