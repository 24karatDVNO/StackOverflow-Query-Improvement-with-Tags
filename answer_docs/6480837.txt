<p>Honestly I would just advise creating images of the actually coupons or generating a pdf.  I'm assuming you are probably generating barcodes for all the coupons already, so generating the actually images shouldn't be to hard using php (or whatever the code choice might be).</p>

<p>Here is some info on php image creation, but SO would probably be a better source for examples.</p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagecreate.php" rel="nofollow">http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagecreate.php</a></p>

<p>Then you could just list the images.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;img src&gt;
&lt;img src&gt;
&lt;img src&gt;
...
</code></pre>

<p>There's no sense it recreating the wheel.  </p>
