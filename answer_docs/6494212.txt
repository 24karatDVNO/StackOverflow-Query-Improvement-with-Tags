<p>That doesn't even look like Objective-C.</p>

<p>Having a property named <code>Init</code> is quite confusing and what is <code>String</code>?</p>

<p>Perhaps this is what you want:</p>

<pre><code>NSString *initialString = self.carte.titre;
originalCarte.initialLetter = [initialString characterAtIndex:0];
</code></pre>
