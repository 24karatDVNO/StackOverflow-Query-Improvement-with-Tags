<p>Figured out the solution.  I needed to have TX and RX on two separate threads.</p>

<p>RX Thread does this forever:</p>

<pre><code>pcap_loop(handle, -1, got_packet, NULL);
</code></pre>

<p>Then I call the TX thread whenever I want, which does this (and loops however many times I need):</p>

<pre><code>pcap_sendpacket(t, TxPacket, DataLen + 42);
</code></pre>

<p>This solved the problem.</p>
