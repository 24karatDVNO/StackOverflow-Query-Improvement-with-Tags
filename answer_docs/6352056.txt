<p>For a small application, direct reading and writing to <em>localStorage</em> is probaby OK, however I think in a more complex application it would be a good idea to wrap <em>localStorage</em> and provide an API with get and set methods suitable for the particular application (e.g. get/setMySpecialObject and get/setMySpecialValue).</p>

<p>I don't think an application should care about where data is stored, it should just call an API to get or set it. The code behind the API works out how to store it and where to get it from. Genearlly it's most efficient to read and write data into an object and read/write to <em>localStorage</em> behind the scenes. Get data from <em>localStorage</em> the first time it is requested and cache it. If it's updated along the way, write back to <em>localStorage</em> as appropriate, it should not require commands from the application to do so. </p>
