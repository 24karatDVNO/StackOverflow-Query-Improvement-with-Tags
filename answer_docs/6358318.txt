<p>Not sure if there is a simple pure css based solution. </p>

<p>A method that somewhat achieves what you want is to have <a href="http://www.css3.info/preview/text-shadow/" rel="nofollow">text shadow</a> on the text floating above the border, using a color that blends with the general color of the background. You can tweak the values such that the border will (at least mostly) fade away behind the text. This will of course also fade away the background image, replacing it with the color of the shadow, but it might look fairly nice anyway. (Having a more solid background for the text will make it easier to read, too).</p>
