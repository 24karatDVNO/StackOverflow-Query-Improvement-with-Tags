<p>It looks like they use A-Za-z0-9 for generating their URLs, and if my calculations are right, this means at any one time they can probably store a database of 61,474,519 of those codes mapped onto the long URLs. Assuming certain links can expire, or people can delete links they have made, it's safe to assume they won't run out of possibilities soon...and hey if they do, just make the links up to 8 characters- then you get 3,381,098,545 possibilities =P</p>
