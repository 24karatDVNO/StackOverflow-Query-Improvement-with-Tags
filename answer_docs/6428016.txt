<p>The only issue I can think of off the top of my head is that you will need to change your existing code and include all 3 fields if you want to get any use out of indexing on those bit columns.</p>

<p>Bit fields by their nature are not very selective.  To get good selectivity you will need to create a covering index on all 3 fields, and then include all 3 in your <code>WHERE</code> clauses so you get optimum seeks.</p>
