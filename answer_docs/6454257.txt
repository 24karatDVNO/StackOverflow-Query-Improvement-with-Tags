<p>I think this is not possible and should not be possible as this is a security issue. Consider the following scenario:</p>

<p>A malicious site example.com shows you a harmless looking form where they have hidden such a file upload textfield with the already inserted value '/etc/passwd'. They have used either a hidden_field or just display:none with CSS.</p>

<p>You fill in the form and submit without knowing you have also sent a file.</p>
