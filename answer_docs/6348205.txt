<p>These are limitations of using the <code>AlertDialog.Builder</code>. As suggested, your views are not inflated yet. This doesn't necessarily mean that there's no way to access these views until the dialog is shown. You can inflate the views yourself and modify at will. See the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/dialogs.html#CustomDialog" rel="nofollow">docs on custom dialogs</a>. You can inflate your own views and then use <code>setView</code> to set the <code>View</code> for the <code>Dialog</code>. Unfortunately this does negate a lot of the simplicity that the <code>Builder</code> provides.</p>
