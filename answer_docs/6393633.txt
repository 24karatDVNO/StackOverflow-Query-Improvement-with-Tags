<p>You could just say <code>string.split("^")</code> to divide the string into an array containing each segment. The only caveat is that it will divide consecutive caret characters into an empty string. You could protect against this by either collapsing consecutive carats down into a single one, or detecting empty strings in the resultant array.</p>

<p>Does that help?</p>
