<p>The only messaging supported by the API is via the <a href="http://developer.linkedin.com/docs/DOC-1044" rel="nofollow">Messaging API</a>, which only allows for messages to be sent from one connection to another... so in theory, you (as in you the developer, not the application itself, as it has no connections) could send a message to any of your applications user's that you also happen to be connected to in some way. The Messaging API is pretty clear though that messages must be triggered by a specific action, and the maximum number of recipients is 10.</p>

<p>So the short answer is, not possible, although the above may be a bit of a workaround. An alternative would be to ask the user directly for their email address once they have completed the LI process and then you can contact them as you wish without running into API limits/restrictions.</p>
