<p>The speech recognizer can be triggered every few seconds without UI. You might need to write your own code to decide when is good to record and when is not (you get an audio buffer you could peek through) - or your could do something in your own UI.</p>

<p>I think you could re-trigger it over and over again. Not sure it'd work perfectly but worth a try.</p>
