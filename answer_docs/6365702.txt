<p>I would venture to guess you are accidentally creating multiple references when using MongoDB. There seems to be little value in creating a Graph for the database in which none of the nodes are shared.</p>

<p>I have used <a href="http://www.db4o.com/" rel="nofollow">db4o</a> and it will maintain a single instance of an object such that if you change it, then reference it from another Object the change will be "reflected." I put that in quotes because they should be the same object due to the way graphs work.</p>
