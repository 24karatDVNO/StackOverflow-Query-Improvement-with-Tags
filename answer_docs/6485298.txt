<p>Use a case/when construct in your order by clause... In this case, I set values to 1, 2 or 3, THEN order by the last visit date...</p>

<pre><code>select
      YT.*
   from
      YourTable YT
   order by
      case when YT.Picture = "noPic" then 1
           when YT.Picture = "PrivatePic" then 2
           else 3 
      end,
      YT.Last_Visit_Date desc
</code></pre>
