<p>The / / are just border characters, you can actually use almost any one you want, as long as they they do not occur elsewhere in the regex. /i means case-insensitive, meaning the patterns will math either upper or lower case.</p>

<p>The important thing to remember, is if you put \ in front of a character it will escape it, and not treat it as the special character it is.</p>
