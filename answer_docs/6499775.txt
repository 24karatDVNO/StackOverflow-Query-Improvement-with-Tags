<p>This is the whole point of reference variables. <code>b.SetAuthor(...)</code> is effectively shorthand for <code>[whatever b points to].SetAuthor(...)</code>, and in this case what <code>b</code> points to is the same as what <code>c</code> points to. The 'real' object is somewhere else, and <code>b</code> and <code>c</code> are both just ways of reaching it. It's more obvious in languages with explicit pointers.</p>
