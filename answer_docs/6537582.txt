<p>I kinda solved it using the following:</p>

<pre><code>var items = from r in TestaccountRequest.Queryable
            group r by r.RequestCodeId into g
            select g.ElementAt(0);
var grouped = from r in items.ToList()
              group r by new { Year = r.Requested.Year,
                               Month = r.Requested.Month } into g 
              select new { g.Key.Year, g.Key.Month, Count = g.Count() };
</code></pre>

<p>but I gues thats not the best solution as all objects are getting fetched from the DB, but at least it is working for now, but please provide a better solution if available.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
I now solved it using HQL:</p>

<pre><code>HqlBasedQuery query = new HqlBasedQuery(typeof(ActivationCodeTestaccountRequestRecord),
            "SELECT DISTINCT r.ActivationCodeId, YEAR(r.Requested), MONTH(r.Requested) " +
            "FROM ActivationCodeTestaccountRequestRecord r");
var items = from object[] row in (ArrayList)ActiveRecordMediator.ExecuteQuery(query)
            group row by new { Year = row[1], Month =row[2] } into g2
            select new { Year = g2.Key.Year, Month = g2.Key.Month, Count = g2.Count() };
</code></pre>
