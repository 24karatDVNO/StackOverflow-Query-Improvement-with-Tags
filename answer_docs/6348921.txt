<p>(Can't get my test project to actually send the HTTP 500, only seems to do that when I don't want it to ;-)</p>

<p>In the off-chance that this will help you, try wrapping you client service call and inspect the <code>response</code> in the debugger to see if it contains the error string you are trying to capture.</p>

<pre><code>    using (new OperationContextScope(service1.InnerChannel))
    {
        try
        {
            result = service1.GetData("5");
        }
        catch (System.Exception e)
        {
            string msg = e.ToString();
        }
        HttpResponseMessageProperty response = (HttpResponseMessageProperty)
            OperationContext.Current.IncomingMessageProperties[HttpResponseMessageProperty.Name];
    }
</code></pre>
