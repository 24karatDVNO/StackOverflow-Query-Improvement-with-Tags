<p>A string can just "hold" characters - that's what a String is.</p>

<p>Of course, those characters could denote a <em>stringified representation</em> of an array of objects, such as the string <code>[1, "two", MyCoolClass(5, 8.0)]</code>.  But that would just be some quasi-arbitrary encoding, and you'd have to do some work to convert it back again (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" rel="nofollow">JSON</a> for a real-world example).</p>

<p>So the short answer is "no", but the real answer would be to ask for clarification of what it is you mean...</p>
