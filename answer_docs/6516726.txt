<pre><code>Can i make msi or smth like that, to install database on existing server.
</code></pre>

<p>Yes, you can. There are two approaches:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write a custom action which connects to your server and runs an SQL script that creates the database. This is complicated but free.</li>
<li>Use a commercial setup authoring tool which supports SQL scripts. It's much easier, but you need to purchase a license.</li>
</ol>

<p>Yes, they are called billboards. The native MSI billboards support is very limited, so I recommend an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2335354/how-to-create-custom-ui-for-msi-in-wix">external UI</a> solution.</p>

<p>If you want a free solution, you can try <a href="http://wix.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow noreferrer">WiX</a>. It supports both external UI and SQL scripts. These features will need some work, but they are doable.</p>

<p>Let me know if you want some recommendation for commercial tools.</p>
