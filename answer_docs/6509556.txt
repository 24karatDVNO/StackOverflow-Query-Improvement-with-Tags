<p>One option is to add a <code>Status</code> property to your <code>Person</code> type and bind to that in your grid instead. If you don't wish to add a <code>Status</code> property to your model, then you could create a <code>PersonViewModel</code> instead with this additional property, and bind your grid to a collection of <code>PersonViewModel</code>.</p>
