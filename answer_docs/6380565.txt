<p>IE 9 has one more way of not clearing all the cookies. 
If you open the Dialog to Clear Cookies from the Options Menu in IE 9, you will notice that the first options says "Preserve Favorites Website Data." Leave this unchecked and you usual clear cookies, close browser should work.</p>

<p>Let me know if this helps, I think this should do the trick ;)</p>
