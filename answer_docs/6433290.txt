<p>You may have to surround your parameter with quotation marks, something like:</p>

<pre><code>/connectionString="[CONNECTIONSTRING]"
</code></pre>

<p>That's just a guess, I'm basing it on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2w2fhwzz%28VS.71%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2w2fhwzz%28VS.71%29.aspx</a> which suggests that values with spaces in them need to be quoted. The documentation doesn't address your situation exactly, so it's hard to tell.</p>
