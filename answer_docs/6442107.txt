<p>If your CSS is not too huge, you should combine it in one file.  This will improve your download speed and make it easier on the user.</p>

<p>If you would like to keep the styles separate, use comments in your CSS, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>#######NAV STYLES######

.nav li {something:something;}
.nav li a {something:something;}

######MAIN STYLES######

#main #wrapper {something:something;}
</code></pre>
