<p>You cannot reference-by-name elements in a template. There is no matching code-behind/designer property generated by templates.</p>

<p>You want to bind the visibility of a control in the template to a property of your data items. That means you will need to add a property to your data items. Can you provide more details of your data items? If the property is a bool value, use a VisibilityConvertor (dime a dozen on this site).</p>

<p>Think of templates as wanting to always pull settings from the bindings, rather than have settings stuffed into them from the outside.</p>
