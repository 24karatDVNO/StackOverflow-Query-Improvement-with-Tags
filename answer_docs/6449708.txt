<p>At android there are 2 categories: the lower one, with g1 and the better with Nexus 1 if you want to develop games.
Those cross platform libraries I think they can do cross platform "Hello word" applications.
To generate a correct Blackberry networking application or an optimized Android graphic application (to both categories),  I highly doubt it!</p>

<ul>
<li>the frameworks has the big cons, when you want to look outside of the sandbox. Those 3-4 custom stuff, plugin often cost more, than the whole application written fast until that point.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, "Hello word" +very basic, only soft stuff with cross platform.
High performance, nice graphic, easier to bugfix, support, professional work: develop for each platform and categories.</p>
