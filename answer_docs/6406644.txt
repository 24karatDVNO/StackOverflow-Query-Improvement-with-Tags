<p>I think @mu's answer is great, but I would like to take the moment to recommend an autocomplete input field. I am currently maintaining one myself, it is called <a href="https://github.com/betamos/Better-Autocomplete" rel="nofollow">Better Autocomplete</a>. It can handle your server's response, despite what data it returns. Other, more widespread scripts, are <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Autocomplete" rel="nofollow">jQuery UI</a> and <a href="http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-autocomplete/" rel="nofollow">another third party jQuery plugin</a>.</p>
