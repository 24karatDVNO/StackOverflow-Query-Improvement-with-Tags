<p>Figured out what was wrong. I needed to change the CGPoint I got from the touches into GL point like this:</p>

<pre><code>CGPoint location = [touch locationInView: [touch view]];
</code></pre>

<p>location = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL: location];</p>

<p>Silly me. Should have thought about this before.</p>
