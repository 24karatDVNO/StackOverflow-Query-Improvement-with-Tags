<p>Here are some additional questions that you'll also want to consider</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How often do deletes occur. What's your performance budget like? This can affect your choices. The answer to your design will be  different depending of if a user deleting a single row (like lets say an answer on a Q&amp;A site vs deleting records on an hourly basis from a feed)</p></li>
<li><p>How are you going to expose the deleted records in your system. Is it only through administrative purposes or can any user see deleted records. This makes a difference because you'll probably need to come up with a filtering mechanism depending on the user.</p></li>
<li><p>How will foreign key constraints work. Can one table reference another table where there's a deleted record?</p></li>
<li><p>When you add or alter existing tables what happens to the deleted records?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Typically the systems that care a lot about audit use tables as Steve Prentice mentioned. It often has every field from the original table with all the constraints turned off. It often will have a action field to track updates vs deletes, and include a date/timestamp of the change along with the user. </p>
