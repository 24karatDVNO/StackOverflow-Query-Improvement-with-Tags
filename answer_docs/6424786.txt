<p>Now I solved the problem by just maintaining a parent pointer for each node.
So every node will just point to its parent node. In other words each branch is maintained as a linked list.
This linked list will have some properties like many nodes can point to one node but one node is not pointing to more than one node.
Just having the address of any node I can traverse whole branch from bottom to root.</p>
