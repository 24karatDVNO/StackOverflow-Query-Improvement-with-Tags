<p>I ugraded mysql on my local fedora linux machine from 5.1 to 5.5 and had problems with my charset.  I found that the upgrade was not complete just by installing the software.  I had to follow the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html" rel="nofollow">instructions from the MySQL manual</a> after the upgrade to fix a number of problems.  That document has a number of steps that could well fix the issue.  While you shouldn't skip directly to it - running mysql_upgrade was a big help.</p>
