<p>I am not aware of a <code>.Data</code> property for the BindingSource object, but there is a <code>.DataSource</code> property, which can be set to null:</p>

<pre><code>bindingSource.DataSource = null;
</code></pre>

<p>This releases the binding source from the data. However, looking at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.forms.bindingsource.datasource.aspx" rel="nofollow">reference for BindingSource.DataSource</a>:</p>

<pre><code>DataSource property             List results
----------------------------    -------------------------------------------
null with DataMember set        Not supported, raises ArgumentException.
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using a DataMember, you can't set the DataSource to null without an exception.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don't know whether your workaround is a proper way of doing it, but at least now we know that you can't simply bind to null when a DataMember is set.</p>
