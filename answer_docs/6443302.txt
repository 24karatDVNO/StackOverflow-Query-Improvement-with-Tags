<p>you can use custom template for your combobox on the whole as said by RobSiklos, but i think you can do that in xaml itself, writing custom template, use overridedefaultstyle property, use the Textbox instead of Textblock in the content presenter as again, said by RobSiklos.</p>

<p>Then you can also use Triggers like when IsSelected and other properties and handle your stuff over. </p>

<p>See this <a href="http://mark-dot-net.blogspot.com/2007/07/creating-custom-wpf-button-template-in.html" rel="nofollow">link</a> for how to create a custom template and using similar one for your Combobox will hopefully help you. </p>
