<p>Table rendering will always be a problem no matter how much you optimize. IE especially is not going to render the table until it finds the table end tag. If you are not using any client side pagination (TableSorter) then I would suggest using Div's instead of using Table. If you need to use tables then I would suggest a hybrid of Server and Client Side pagination (client with Numbers in pages....Server using Next Batch or something like it)</p>
