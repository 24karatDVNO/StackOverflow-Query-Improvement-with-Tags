<p>As mentioned by several people using validate or postvalidate works for me in all contexts.</p>

<p>However it sounds as if Android's LevelListDrawable resource is a more appropriate option for you - this allows you to select which image is being displayed from a list of images using a simple SetImagelevel call on the imageview.</p>
