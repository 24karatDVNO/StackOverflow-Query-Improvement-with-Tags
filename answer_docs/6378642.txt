<p><code>test2</code> is something that you can put any <code>Object</code> into because it was created via <code>new Object[]</code>.  You can only put <code>Object[]</code>s into <code>test</code> and <code>test3</code> because they were created via a constructor that is stricter : <code>new Object[][]</code>.</p>
