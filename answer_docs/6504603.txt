<p>Managed to figure this out myself. The <code>before_filter :format_for_mobile</code> was before authenticate user, that fixed the /login issue.</p>

<p>For /logout, I had to do the following:</p>

<pre><code># controllers/sessions_controller.rb

class SessionsController &lt; Devise::SessionsController
  before_filter :format_for_mobile, :except =&gt; :destroy
end
</code></pre>
