<p>Why not offer both?  (Seriously - I wrote an app about ten years ago that did this.)  Look up "MOVEit DMZ" or research various FTP servers with web portal integration to see how it's being done today.  </p>

<p>There's also a third way you should consider and was touched on by the Jupload comment: a local control (Flash, Java, ActiveX, Firefox plug-in, etc. that optimizes the upload experience).  If people are uploading multiple large files to your site they may appreciate the speed/reliability boost.  </p>
