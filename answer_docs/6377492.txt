<p>What you currently have i your <code>.htaccess</code> file is not related to your rewrite requests.</p>

<p>Here is what you need:</p>

<p>The first:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ index.php?page=$1
</code></pre>

<p>The second:</p>

<pre><code>RewriteRule ^(.*)/([0-9]*)$ index.php?page=$1&amp;catId=$2
</code></pre>

<p>Be sure to add <code>RewriteEngine on</code> at the top.</p>

<p>Your server will never get the "#someAnchor" part of the url, because no browser in the world will send this as part of the request. The browser keeps it private.</p>
