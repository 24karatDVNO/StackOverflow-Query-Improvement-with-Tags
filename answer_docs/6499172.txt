<p>You may have found a bug in SharePoint web services (not that that's particularly surprising, given the sparseness of their API).</p>

<p>See <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sharepoint2010customization/thread/19eb1a7c-bcc9-44c5-a547-768c8a9386d1" rel="nofollow">here</a>. I didn't look too carefully but BananaRepublic seemed to have a workaround for this problem; I don't know the exact context, so I don't know if it will work for you or not.</p>
