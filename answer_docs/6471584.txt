<p>Depends on what you mean by better.  The best solution is to make the object immutable and just copy the references. </p>

<p>An alternative is to generate or write a copy constructor. The copy constructor can use reflections to copy all the fields.  </p>

<p>For the field types you have, you can make the Object Cloneable and use the clone() methods. (Because the fields are primitives or immutable)</p>
