This repository contains most of the experiment materials used for a study regarding how tags can be used to enhance StackOverflow user queries.
Note that the experiment program present here cannot be run normally, due to the .json file needed to access the StackOverflow dataset through
Google's BigQuery API containing sensitive credentials and not being safely uploadable.
